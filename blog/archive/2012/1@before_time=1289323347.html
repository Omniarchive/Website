Most of them add really cool new features, though. It&rsquo;s highly likely that something like the bridge mod will make it into the game.</p><p>Now, the update.<br />I was going to release this today, but it&rsquo;s 6 pm already and my fianc&eacute;e turns 30 today (I love you, ez!), so I&rsquo;ll go eat a nice dinner instead.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s already done for the update:</p><p>General fixes:<br />* players and mobs in lava or fire no longer spam sound effects<br />* getting hit with a higher damage while recovering from a smaller one now works as intended<br />* lava flows further in the Nether<br />* zombie pigs eventually forgives<br />* added support for custom texture packs<br />* fixed duplicate buttons when resizing screens<br />* zombie pigs and ghasts no longer get hurt by fire or lava<br />* fixed volume sliders now saving properly<br /><br />Multiplayer fixes:<br />* hellworld=true no longer overwrites old save chunks. Player positions will still break if you switch it on a running server, though<br />* boats are now visible to other players<br />* minecarts move nicer<br />* fishing kinda sorta works, but needs more work<br />* sheep and cows look like sheep and cows now<br />* buckets work now<br />* fixed stairs being really difficult to destroy<br />* increased the timeout before &ldquo;Took too long to log in&rdquo;<br />* made it possible to ride carts and boats (pigs should work too..)</p><p>There are a couple of bugs left, like it not being possible to steer the boats yet, and other players not having the riding animation when riding. Fishing also works horribly poorly. Once I&rsquo;ve fixed that tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll release an update for both the server and the client.</p><p>As for the texture packs, it&rsquo;ll look something like this:</p><p><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lbmn2ikmut1qzb7ox.png" class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image"/></p><p>Later on, the server list and world selection in singleplayer will have a similar look to this.</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/1525944516/an-update-is-coming-tomorrow.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;1525944516&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

I have plans on what to do with this.<br />* Fixed the leaf particle colors<br />* Reduced CPU usage for monster spawning, but there&rsquo;s still a lot of work to be done to reduce lag on SMP servers.<br />* Attempted to fix the portal dupe bug where you could exit through a different (new) one than the one you entered through.</p><p>About the portals, it&rsquo;s possible that two portals can lead to the same portal in the Nether. This is because the space down there is compressed by a factor of 8, and I haven&rsquo;t come up with a good way to fix this yet.<br />I might just end up doing an explicit one-to-one binding between portal pairs, but that&rsquo;s nontrivial as it should survive the portal being temporarily destroyed. If you TNT a portal then rebuild it, you&rsquo;d expect it to still lead to the same place, right?</p><p>Hmm.</p><p>More bug updates are coming next week, mainly related to survival mode multi player.</p><p>[edit:]</p><p>Client 1.2.1_01 fixes armor.

I fixed a few bugs with creative mode, so that should be working now as well.</p><p>Now I will rest for a few days, as I&rsquo;m utterly exhausted. After that, I will get cracking on Survival Mode Multiplayer, as it&rsquo;s still the highest priority for the game.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a bug in there now where the cpu usage will shoot up through the roof sometimes, and I think that&rsquo;s related to lighting. Immediately after the release, there was a hang bug where lighting would go into an infinite loop sometimes on existing loaded maps. I &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; that by making the loop always terminate after a certain number of iterations. My guess of what&rsquo;s going on now is that the lighting probably keeps going into that loop over and over again.</p><p>The biggest features that need fixing are;</p><p>* Fixing the performance issues<br />* Health and working enemies<br />* Finishing up the inventory code so the dupe bugs/glitches go away<br />* Figuring out how to run both the normal world and the nexus in parallel.</p><p>I also want to make the portals able to teleport players between servers, both on different IPs and just to a different port on the same IP. Player equipment will follow through the portal and everything! (that will be agreed upon between the servers, so they don&rsquo;t have to trust the client)</p><p>[edit:]</p><p>Oh, and the secret artist is Junkboy.

You&rsquo;ll get more information about exactly how it works soon, as I&rsquo;ve sent out a sneak peek build to two different gaming news sites.</p><p>The portals have a neat particle effect to them as well, and the transition is sufficiently cheesy.</p><p>Biomes got a bit of extra work as well, with the grass/leaf colors more correctly representing both temperature and dampness of the region, and the monster spawning code getting moved into the biome code. Right now, it&rsquo;s all enemies in most biomes, except the hell biome where there&rsquo;s only ghasts and zombie pigs.</p><p>I&rsquo;m looking for a good new name for &ldquo;hell&rdquo;. I want to avoid simply re-using existing religious names, it would be more creative to have something original. At the moment, I&rsquo;m considering both &ldquo;The Slip&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nexus&rdquo;, but neither feels minecrafty enough.</p><p>Also, the Zombie Pigs have a very very gory skin at the moment, but I will change that into something that doesn&rsquo;t have blood in it.

It was a really productive meeting, and we&rsquo;ve got a few ideas we want to do.</p><p>One of them will be to introduce Jeb (the new programmer, will be working web development and helping out in minecraft) and Jakob (the game developer/designer/programmer who will be leading the new game). They will both write a short text introducing themselves and I will post it here. You might already have seen Jeb around the community in different places.</p><p>We will eventually set up a company wide blog somewhere where everyone can post. Perhaps this is a chance to finally use mojang.com for something. There&rsquo;s no real plan to migrate away from this blog, so we&rsquo;ll see how things play out. I like this one too much personally to just quit it!</p><p>One fun thing about starting a new company is choosing your hardware. I went for a &ldquo;decent gaming computer&rdquo; with &ldquo;dual widescreen monitors&rdquo;, and a Logitech MX518 mouse and a Das Keyboard Model S Professional Silent. I guess I&rsquo;m really picky when it comes to input, but I don&rsquo;t really care about the rest, heh. :D<br />The two business/management-people went for MacBooks. Of course.</p><p>And finally I&rsquo;d like to recommend two awesome new indie games:</p><p><strong>Super Crate Box</strong> (Windows) by Vlambeer<br />Available for absolutely free here: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.supercratebox.com%2F&amp;t=MTg0NGU1YTczMjI5ODVkODI4YWRjYTk4NjQ5ZjIwYWZiNWQwNmQ3Mix5TUdqekdRaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F1390641415%2Fweekend-activities">http://www.supercratebox.com/</a><br />Super Crate Box is an action platformer based around a fairly simple mechanic. Pick up a crate to get a point, but when you do, you replace your current weapon with a random new one. You can either kill enemies or just avoid them, and the crates spawn in random location. It gets really hectic after a while, but it&rsquo;s very rewarding.<br />A controller (like an XBox 360 controller) is highly recommended.</p><p><strong>Super Meat Boy</strong> (XBox 360 Live Arcade) by Team Meat<br />Available for a small pile of Microsoft points on XBox Live Arcade<br />Super Meat Boy is a frustration platformer based around being amazing. You play an extremely fragile chunk of meat, wall sliding, sprinting and jumping across a scary large amount of levels. The level design is amazingly perfect, and the game is filled with homages to other games.<br />You will die a lot, though. <br />Fun fact; the Minecraft guy (Steve?) might make it in as an unlockable character in the pc version :D</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/1390641415/weekend-activities.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;1390641415&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

Not as hard as I should, mainly due to a cold and me having the apartment for myself this week (yay, coding in my underwear!).</p><p>We&rsquo;ve signed the papers for the company, and we&rsquo;ve found an office. We haven&rsquo;t signed the office yet, but it&rsquo;s perfect for us and as long as the owner wants us, we&rsquo;ll take it. Mojang is now six people strong, three programmers, one pixel artist, one CEO and one Business Developer. It&rsquo;s likely we&rsquo;ll grow even more in the near future, but this will get us started nicely.</p><p>I was going to send a sneak preview of the Halloween update to a certain website last week for an exclusive preview, but I missed that date pretty bad. I will try to get that update out as soon as possible. The update is going well. There are six new block types (five of them have unique abilities), one new monster, a new dimension, and a couple of bug fixes. Once I get the portals working, I&rsquo;ll have something very interesting going and I&rsquo;ll spend the rest of the time leading up to the release adding new smaller features and polishing stuff.</p><p>And fixing bugs.</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/1351006839/calm-before-the-storm.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;1351006839&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

On Monday, we tried negotiating the office we wanted, but they refused to sign it for less than three years. Signing for three years as an upstart is a bit scary, as that&rsquo;d mean we could neither grow nor shrink during that time. So we&rsquo;re still looking for an office.</p><p>I was supposed to go and talk to Ericsson about some things they&rsquo;re developing that could be interesting for Minecraft, but I had to cancel it. They called me yesterday and gave me some more details, and it sounded really interesting!</p><p>Me and ez went and looked at a location for our wedding next year, and fell in love with the place. It&rsquo;s got a great view of the water, is fairly central in Stockholm, and has two freaking saunas! TWO! What&rsquo;s even cooler is that they&rsquo;ve got space for all guests to spend the night if they want to.</p><p>We met and spoke with two different artists about possibly hiring them. Both are really talented and seem eager to get involved. Hopefully we can get this sorted as soon as the company is in place.</p><p>For the company, we&rsquo;ve spoken to lawyers and are currently working on getting it all actually registered and in place so we can start paying salaries and so. Transferring everything I made in my own private company over is going to require some paperwork to get correct.</p><p>I also participated in a podcast or two, and did a couple of interviews via email. I had to cancel a real-world interview yesterday morning because I had to catch up on sleep.</p><p>Usually, I make sure not to work on weekends as much as possible, but I&rsquo;m making an exception to talk to a game developer/backend guy tomorrow. I&rsquo;ve met him a couple of times before, but I won&rsquo;t say that I think he&rsquo;d be a great fit, as that&rsquo;d give him a really good position when negotiating . ;)</p><p>I probably forgot a few things..</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/1227209365/the-week-that-was.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;1227209365&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

This scales easily with out needs, and even has support for a CDN in Amazon CloudFront. A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is basically a bunch of servers all over the world which redirect so you download the files from the server nearest to you.</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t been able to move the resources (sounds and music yet) because those used a rather ridiculous auto updating scheme that was different from the rest of the game. I will fix this today.</p><p>Minecraft Classic is also offline for the time being since I wasn&rsquo;t able to get it to download from the S3 easily. I will try to get this up today as well, but I can&rsquo;t promise anything there. It is coming back, though.</p><p><strong>For the CPU load, I did this:</strong></p><p>The problem was that I had written my own database early on before I even had decided to sell the game yet, and it kind of stuck around. I sat down and set up a proper RDB database (mysql). Currently, this is also running via Amazon Cloud.</p><p>The first version of the DB hit the CPU cap pretty fast until I realized I could scale it up to a much faster database with just a couple of clicks. Now it&rsquo;s currently configured to be quite a bit faster than we actually need, but since I like the idea of actually having MORE power than needed somewhere, I&rsquo;m keeping it that way for a few days.</p><p><strong>Pending payments:</strong></p><p>After I temporarily took out the sound and music updating, the website got a lot faster, but before that payments were queuing up, so it could take quite some time for some people to actually get their game after they bought it.</p><p>What happened is that paypay tried to send the notification immediately, but when the system is busy, it adds the notification to an internal queue in paypal&rsquo;s system, and resends it after a short period of time. If it fails a SECOND time, it increases the counter and tries even later. So if you got unlucky, it could time out three times in a row, and you&rsquo;d have to wait a fairly long time. All the payments are still secure, but they just didn&rsquo;t get processed immediately.</p><p>If you bought the game and didn&rsquo;t receive it immediately, I&rsquo;m sorry to keep you waiting. Please wait until tomorrow or so before contacting us, though.. We&rsquo;re getting a LOT of emails about accounts that have already been updated automatically when we check them.</p><p><strong>Future updates:</strong></p><p>TkTech is pretty much done with his rewrite which will give minecraft.net a much more modern codebase.

The first thing that&rsquo;s needed in any case is something that tells the player to press &ldquo;I&rdquo; to access the inventory. Once that is up, there could be a small &ldquo;recipy&rdquo; icon in the upper right corner. Pressing that opens up a tech tree with everything except wood planks grayed out into mysterious question marks. Hovering the wood planks shows the recipy (tree trunk -&gt; wood planks!), and if the player completes that recipy he unlocks the next recipes in the tech tree thing. The recipes link into each other in somewhat logical ways, and can be non-crafting things like showing that a better pickaxe is requires to get ore, or that ore in a furnace produces ingots.</p><p>Note that you don&rsquo;t actually HAVE to unlock anything in the tech tree to be able to craft those things, it&rsquo;s just meant as a way to show people what can be made, and add some kind of exploration to it.</p><p>Once we have achievements, one of them can be for completing the entire crafting tech tree. :D</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/1138010174/seecret-saturday-update-also-tutorials.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;1138010174&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

Copying a physical book costs money, but copying a digital movie is free. In fact, simply moving a movie from one hard drive to another actually copies the movie first, then deletes the original. Copying games is also free. No resources are lost, nobody loses any money, and more people are having fun.</p><p>To people who want to get paid for their digital works, myself included, that is a bit of a problem. All of society and economics is based on an old outdated model where giving something to someone would rid the original owner of their copy, so everyone who wanted a copy had to buy one from someone else who would lose theirs, and the only source of new copies was you. There might be actual development costs involved in making these copies. For example, for every wheel in the market, someone had to make that wheel. With digital copies, you only need to make the wheel once.</p><p>I won&rsquo;t bother analyzing why people copy games and other digital media, as that&rsquo;s really a moot point. We&rsquo;ve got an amazingly effective way of distributing culture that is extremely beneficial for humanity, but it clashes with our current economical models. Piracy will win in the long run. It has to. The alternative is too scary.</p><p>If someone pirates Minecraft instead of buying it, it means I&rsquo;ve lost some &ldquo;potential&rdquo; revenue. Not actual revenue, as I can never go into debt by people pirating the game too much, but I might&rsquo;ve made even more if that person had bought the game instead. But what if that person likes that game, talks about it to his or her friends, and then I manage to convince three of them to buy the game? I&rsquo;d make three actual sales instead of blocking out the potentially missed sale of the original person which never cost me any money in the first case.</p><p>Instead of just relying on guilt tripping pirates into buying, or wasting time and money trying to stop them, I can offer online-only services that actually add to the game experience. Online level saving, centralized skins, friends lists and secure name verification for multiplayer. None of these features can be accessed by people with pirated versions of the game, and hopefully they can be features that turn pirates from thieves into potential customers.</p><p>Please don&rsquo;t interpret this text as me being fine with people pirating Minecraft. I&rsquo;d MUCH rather have people pay for it so I can reinvest in hiring people and developing more cool games in the future. It&rsquo;s also quite possible that if I get into a business deal with a larger company, there might be a larger push towards fighting piracy mostly because they&rsquo;d require it, and I understand why they&rsquo;d want that.</p><p>But why fight the biggest revolution in information flow since the printing press when you could easily work with it by adding services that actually add some value beyond the free act of making a digital copy?</p><p>In other news, I&rsquo;m voting for either Piratpartiet or Milj&ouml;partiet in the Swedish elections on Sunday.</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/1121596044/how-piracy-works.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;1121596044&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

Me, the other secret guy with the game idea we&rsquo;re going to make, and Daniel Kaplan.</p><p>Daniel will be in charge of the business side of things, and will help organize actually getting this company started.<br />I asked him to write a short introduction:</p><blockquote><p>Hi cyberspace!</p><p>My name is Daniel Kaplan and I and 24 years old. I have been dreaming and playing games for as long as I can remember. This little post is about me so you Minecraft players can get to know me and get in touch with me.</p><p>I will start off with where I come from and who I am. I am born and raised in a small town called Sk&ouml;vde in Sweden (between the big two lakes). I have played games my whole life and it all started with a little NES and Super Mario Bros. 2 The whole experience that I could manipulate a TV (I didn&rsquo;t know better at that time) was really exciting and it hooked instantaneously. This eventually led to where I am today. I have always dreamed of designing games for Nintendo but I guess that dream has to wait for a couple of years :)</p><p>Prior to my new job at Mojang I was running an indie dev company called Ludosity (<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ludosity.com%2F&amp;t=YjVmMTg5ZjNhY2U0YjU1NjU1NThlYmI1N2M3OTc2ZTcxNGFjNjM4Nix1QjA2N1JyaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F1114516935%2Fthree-man-strong"></a><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ludosity.com&amp;t=ZTk4Y2NiYTU3NjgwZTQ1MjMzYWNkOGIzYTNkNDRiYTczZjU1NjE1MCx1QjA2N1JyaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F1114516935%2Fthree-man-strong">www.ludosity.com</a>) with my friends that I met at the University of Sk&ouml;vde. The biggest title we have created yet is Bob Came in Pieces that you can find on Steam (but soon some even cooler projects will be announced!). It has really been a great time with both ups and downs and I felt that it was time to move on. To be honest, the current team at Ludosity is probably the best. We managed to hire Daniel Remar (<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.remar.se%2Fdaniel&amp;t=ZWFjZjIzMDQxODhkNmRlNTRkZWVkNGExOTEzMTY2M2QwOTkwODg4NCx1QjA2N1JyaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F1114516935%2Fthree-man-strong"></a><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.remar.se%2Fdaniel&amp;t=ZWFjZjIzMDQxODhkNmRlNTRkZWVkNGExOTEzMTY2M2QwOTkwODg4NCx1QjA2N1JyaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F1114516935%2Fthree-man-strong">www.remar.se/daniel</a>) how cool isn&rsquo;t that? During my time at Ludosity I got the honor to work and get to know a lot of great people and I hope that we can cooperate in the future with Mojang in some way.</p><p>At Mojang I will work with different things. First I need to get to know you guys and your needs and what makes Minecraft special for you and how we can make Minecraft an even better game! So my first days at Mojang will be to look for alternative solutions for Paypal and I will eventually also take on the support so Notch can concentrate on what he does best: code and design Minecraft :) The whole thing with me getting hired is that Notch can now concentrate even more on Minecraft and create a better experience for you guys and I will take care of non-coding stuff. I know I will have a blast with you, and Notch and I are really looking forward to working with you guys.</p><p>I also wrote something similar during my time at Ludosity so you can read even more about me there: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fludosity.com%2F2010%2F03%2Fabout-me%2F&amp;t=ZWFkMzZkNjZjOGNjZGNlZTFjYzBjYjBlMWE1ZjllYTMxODBjZWVjOSx1QjA2N1JyaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F1114516935%2Fthree-man-strong"></a><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fludosity.com%2F2010%2F03%2Fabout-me%2F&amp;t=ZWFkMzZkNjZjOGNjZGNlZTFjYzBjYjBlMWE1ZjllYTMxODBjZWVjOSx1QjA2N1JyaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F1114516935%2Fthree-man-strong">http://ludosity.com/2010/03/about-me/</a></p><p>And if you still feel like you need to know more about me (or just want to say hi) you can contact me on: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=mailto%3Adaniel%40mojang.com&amp;t=MTI5MDE0YzUwZGZlZDhiMjFlN2Q4OTQ4ZTAzZjgxMWZmYTEzZjJlZSx1QjA2N1JyaQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F1114516935%2Fthree-man-strong">daniel@mojang.com</a></p><p>Thanks for now and don&rsquo;t hesitate to get in touch :)</p></blockquote>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/1114516935/three-man-strong.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;1114516935&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

<p>My development speed has taken a major toll with all the recent developments, as I&rsquo;ve been in meetings every day this week except for today. I keep telling myself it&rsquo;s for the best so I&rsquo;ll have plenty of time to do actual development later on, but at the moment it&rsquo;s a bit frustrating. And exciting. At the same time. :O</p>
<p>And.. Paypal. On the 25'th, they limited my account for unspecified reasons (a suspicious withdrawal or deposit! wow, thank you for that amazingly detailed information), and asked me for a bunch of vague documents. I did my best to give them what they asked for.</p>
<p>My account is still limited. I&rsquo;ve called them three times, they keep telling me it&rsquo;s being reviewed. Most recently they told me it&rsquo;d take up to two more weeks for it to get resolved, and that if they decide something bad&rsquo;s being going on, they&rsquo;re going to keep the money.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s over 600000 euro in there. Money I was planning on investing in the new company.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll get sorted out, but this is kind of frustrating.</p> 

[edit:]
Just to clear things up: I withdraw everything from paypal every week. They limited my account just as sales started spiking, so this money has accumulated since they limited the account.            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/1096322756/working-on-a-friday-update-crying-over-paypal.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;1096322756&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

I will be the main developer, and I will keep working on it just as I have now, but there will be people supporting me, such as an artist, a web site developer and a business guy to help sort out all deals and make sure that things like the Creeper plushies actually happens.<br />My friend (name withheld for a while for office political reasons) will lead development of a game idea he and I have talked about for a few years. It will be developed in parallel with Minecraft, and has a fairly different style both in visuals and gameplay. Everyone working at the company will be involved in both projects to some degree.</p><p>We&rsquo;ll get an actual office type of thing somewhere in Stockholm. We&rsquo;ll have mandatory game playing hours every week to make sure people are a jour with the latest games (indie and otherwise), and to help build office spirit.</p><p>If you live in (or can move to) Stockholm, are good at 2D graphics (pixels, gui, illustration), play a lot of games, and want to get a new job, please email jobs@mojang.com with a work sample and a short introduction and a summary of what you&rsquo;ve done before.</p><p>We&rsquo;re also looking for a web developer. Ideally this person should both be able to handle the front end and the back end of web development. If you know what a &ldquo;Cloud&rdquo; is and can explain it to me, that&rsquo;s a huge plus. ;)</p><p>[edit:]</p><p>If you&rsquo;re worried this means I&rsquo;ll spend more time on administration:</p><p>I spent way too much time already doing non-development stuff, like talking to paypal about them unlocking my account, traveling abroad, and sorting through support emails to see what bugs there are.</p><p>I will now hire a person to do all this for me, and some more people to help do the stuff I can&rsquo;t do well myself (like the website, and some of the art (the armor)). I&rsquo;m already getting amazing help with the sounds from C418, so I know getting help just makes me more productive. :D</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/1075326804/hiring-some-people-getting-an-office-and-all.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;1075326804&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">
