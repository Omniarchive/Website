I assume this nonsense is partly just their lawyers being lawyers, and a result of trademark law being the way it is.</p><p>About half a year ago, our lawyers recommended us to register &ldquo;Minecraft&rdquo; as a trademark, so we did. I had voted against it initially, but we did it anyway. Better safe than sorry, and all that. At the same time, we also applied for &ldquo;Scrolls&rdquo;, the new game we&rsquo;re working on. We knew of no similarly named games, and we had even googled it to make sure. I&rsquo;m not even sure if you CAN trademark individual words, like &ldquo;Scrolls&rdquo;, but we sent in the application anyway.</p><p>(Disclosure: We&rsquo;ve enforced the trademark for Minecraft once, when there was a minecraft clone on iOS, using our name. People were emailing me saying our iOS version was buggy and bad, so we asked them to change the name of their game, and they did.)</p><p>A while later, out of the blue, we got contacted by Bethesda&rsquo;s lawyers. They wanted to know more about the &ldquo;Scrolls&rdquo; trademark we were applying for, and claimed it conflicted with their existing trademark &ldquo;The Elder Scrolls&rdquo;. I agree that the word &ldquo;Scrolls&rdquo; is part of that trademark, but as a gamer, I have never ever considered that series of (very good) role playing games to be about scrolls in any way, nor was that ever the focal point of neither their marketing nor the public image.<br />The implication that you could own the right to all individual words within a trademark is also a bit scary. We looked things up and realized they didn&rsquo;t have much of a case, but we still took it seriously. Nothing about Scrolls is meant to in any way derive from or allude to their games. We suggested a compromise where we&rsquo;d agree to never put any words in front of &ldquo;Scrolls&rdquo;, and instead call sequels and other things something along the lines of &ldquo;Scrolls - The Banana Expansion&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m not sure if they ever got back to us with a reply to this.</p><p>Today, I got a 15 page letter from some Swedish lawyer firm, saying they demand us to stop using the name Scrolls, that they will sue us (and have already paid the fee to the Swedish court), and that they demand a pile of money up front before the legal process has even started.</p><p>I assume this is all some more or less automated response to us applying for the trademark.

That&rsquo;s cool and all, but.. To quote the video, the island in the video is one km^2. Let&rsquo;s assume a modest island height of just eight meters, and we end up with 0.008 km^3. At 64 atoms per cubic millimeter (four per millimeter), that is a total of 512 000 000 000 000 000 atoms. If each voxel is made up of one byte of data, that is a total of 512 petabytes of information, or about 170 000 three-terrabyte harddrives full of information. In reality, you will need way more than just one byte of data per voxel to do colors and lighting, and the island is probably way taller than just eight meters, so that estimate is very optimistic.</p><p>So obviously, it&rsquo;s not made up of that many unique voxels.</p><p>In the video, you can make up loads of repeated structured, all roughly the same size. Sparse voxel octrees work great for this, as you don&rsquo;t need to have unique data in each leaf node, but can reference the same data repeatedly (at fixed intervals) with great speed and memory efficiency. This explains how they can have that much data, but it also shows one of the biggest weaknesses of their engine.</p><p>Another weakness is that voxels are horrible for doing animation, because there is no current fast algorithms for deforming a voxel cloud based on a skeletal mesh, and if you do keyframe animation, you end up with a LOT of data. It&rsquo;s possible to rotate, scale and translate individual chunks of voxel data to do simple animation (imagine one chunk for the upper arm, one for the lower, one for the torso, and so on), but it&rsquo;s not going to look as nice as polygon based animated characters do.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a very pretty and very impressive piece of technology, but they&rsquo;re carefully avoiding to mention any of the drawbacks, and they&rsquo;re pretending like what they&rsquo;re doing is something new and impressive. In reality, it&rsquo;s been done several times before.</p><p>There&rsquo;s the very impressive looking Atomontage Engine: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGshc8GMTa1Y&amp;t=MmQxYTM4YjRjZTA5ODBiZmFjZjQ3N2M5NmZiYjVkYzljMTM0ZDJiOSxkb0J6dVlCbg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F8386977075%2Fits-a-scam">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gshc8GMTa1Y</a></p><p>Ken Silverman (the guy who wrote the Build engine, used in Duke Nukem 3D) has been working on a voxel engine called Voxlap, which is the basis for Voxelstein 3d: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DoB1eMC9Jdsw&amp;t=ZDdiNjhkMWRlOWZiZTAzNjI3M2U4N2Q1MmFjYjA0MGEyZGJiNTE0Myxkb0J6dVlCbg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F8386977075%2Fits-a-scam">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB1eMC9Jdsw</a></p><p>And there&rsquo;s more: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DxUe4ofdz5oI&amp;t=MWYxY2Q0MWNlMThhZWQ0Y2I1ZDdiZGMzNDlmZDc5NTNiMGEyNzVhMyxkb0J6dVlCbg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F8386977075%2Fits-a-scam">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe4ofdz5oI</a> <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DlEHIUC4LNFE&amp;t=M2IzMmQyZWQwZjM1MzljNDY5ZWRjMWRiNDY2ZThkZjVmNzRkZGRkMCxkb0J6dVlCbg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F8386977075%2Fits-a-scam">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEHIUC4LNFE</a> <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZl9CiGJiZuc&amp;t=ZmExZGQzMjkyMDg4NGMwZjcxZjExNDc4MTQzNmM4ZWE5MjlhMTY1Myxkb0J6dVlCbg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F8386977075%2Fits-a-scam">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl9CiGJiZuc</a></p><p>They&rsquo;re hyping this as something new and revolutionary because they want funding.

Ryan send me this interesting email about what different tradeoffs there are, and his experiences working with it:</p><blockquote><p>Very cool! Off the top of my head, here&rsquo;s a list of the main points:<br /><br />Implications behind changing height:<br /><br />-  Memory Implications: Due to the way chunks are architected internally,  the only relatively-easy way of increasing level height is to double it.  As a result, memory usage can spiral out of control very quickly when  increasing the number of bits available to the Y axis. A somewhat  short-sighted view would be to point out that this is wholly manageable  in SSP, but pragmatically, SMP is already a hornet&rsquo;s nest when it comes  to RAM usage, and the only way to increase the level height would be to  neatly double the memory footprint. Ouch!<br /><br />- CPU Implications: Chunk terrain generation occurs in pieces on the  X/Z plane, but expects the chunk to be fully populated along the Y  axis, from bedrock to sky. To be fair, much of this can be mitigated by  the fact that any terrain above a certain cutoff can be assumed to be  completely air, and any terrain below a certain cutoff can be assumed to  be completely stone, thus eliminating the need for temperature /  humidity / biome calculations far down in the level or high up in the  level. Nonetheless, it&rsquo;s still a cache-thrashing memory-fill operation.  Worse still, due to the fact that subterranean features are populated  per-chunk, to maintain a consistent distribution of ore you would need  to double the number of calls made to any given feature generator as  well for each doubling of the Y axis. While this is relatively cheap for  things like ore, it&rsquo;s eclipsed by the idea that cave generation would  need to occur along the entire Y axis, and being a recursive function,  this has the potential to get very costly very quickly.<br /><br />- Storage Implications: Anything stored in memory needs to be  serialized to disk and read back from disk. Given the fact that in SSP,  the number-one performance killer - even on my beastly computer - is  disk I/O, it would be a highly questionable idea to double the amount of  data that needs to be written out to disk. I&rsquo;m not completely sure if  chunks are gzipped before being written to disk, or if that only occurs  to chunks when transmitted over the network, but if they are, this  simply robs from Peter to pay Paul - it mitigates the disk I/O issue  while increasing the enormity of the CPU issue.<br /><br />- Network Implications: On SMP, Chunks need to be sent to many more  people many times more often than in SSP. It can be taken for granted,  from a client&rsquo;s perspective, just how much data needs to be shoved  around by the server, and although network packets are gzipped, it&rsquo;s  still an additional networking load, and still an additional CPU load as  well.<br /><br />Regarding changing the level height, it was &ldquo;easy&rdquo; to the extent  that it took me around 4 hours yesterday morning to do it, but only  because I&rsquo;ve been poking around the engine internals since January and  have been mentally keeping track of all of the assumptions in the code  on exactly that topic. From top to bottom:<br /><br />- Search through the codebase for &lt;&lt; 11 and &lt;&lt; 7, replace with &lt;&lt; 12 and &lt;&lt; 8 as necessary.<br />-  Search through the codebase for 128, this will hit the majority of  places that assume the map height as being 128, such as tile height  checks.<br /> - When changing the above locations, save yourself a recompile and make  sure to change any variables from bytes to shorts or ints if you&rsquo;re  increasing them past 128. Being a C++ engineer, I keep forgetting that  everything is implied as signed in Java.<br /> - Search through the codebase for 127, this will hit the remainder of places that assume the map height as being 128.<br />-  Search through the codebase for 64 and 63, this will hit the places  that assume sea level is at 64, as well as Iron&rsquo;s ore generator height  cutoff. Personally, I dialed sea level up to 96 from 64, rather than  fully double it up to 128, in order to have 32 additional tiles&rsquo; worth  of water height, but have an entire 96 additional tiles&rsquo; worth of land  height.<br /> - Fix up the level feature generators for Redstone, diamond, gold et al.<br />- Visually grep through all of the level feature generator classes, doubling the RNG baseline and spread for each one.<br />- Change a few instances of 32768 to 65536 to accommodate 16*256*16 rather than 16*128*16.<br /> - I&rsquo;m not sure how much of this is a result of JAD and how much of it is  actual code, but there are a few instances of &ldquo;char whatever = &rsquo;\200&rsquo;;&rdquo;  in the MCP codebase, change it to a short or int containing 256 instead  of 128.<br /><br />I have to say that the game was *remarkably* performant with the Y  height pushed up to 256. I imagine 512 might not be too bad on my beast  of a machine, either, though 1024 would be pushing it. That said, one of  my short-term &ldquo;just for fun&rdquo; goals is to see if I can&rsquo;t get the Nether  to populate from 0-127, the main world from 128-255, your Sky dimension  from 256-383, and then that one group of modders&rsquo; new dimension, the  Aether, from 384-511. That would be epic.<br /><br />Additionally, there&rsquo;s a mod that some guy made that re-works chunks  to be 16x16x16 (it appears), but I&rsquo;m rather nonplused by it. The bug  list is as long as my arm, and it doesn&rsquo;t actually rescale any of the  terrain-generation features, so you don&rsquo;t get neat things like this: <a target="_blank" href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fmoogle-tech.com%2Fbce%2Fgorge.png&amp;t=NDk0ZDNmZGMwMzRlODFmMWM5M2MxMzhlZDkyODY4YmRkOTFjYTJkNCxYUzJOMUlkUA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F7799649091%2Fsharing-an-interesting-email">http://moogle-tech.com/bce/gorge.png</a><br /><br />As a result, I&rsquo;m in the process of just trying to re-do what he did  on my own. I&rsquo;m filling all chunks above Y=256 entirely with air, filling  all chunks below 0 with stone, manually invoking the cave generator,  and theoretically things should just work. In principle, theory is a  flimsy thing to go on, and to that end I&rsquo;ve been chasing down bugs for  the past 4-5 hours. At present I&rsquo;m able to get in-game, but the chunks  are horribly mis-arranged, so I suspect I&rsquo;ve missed an important hashing  function somewhere, since that would also explain why it&rsquo;s spitting out  reams of &ldquo;Wrong location!&rdquo; exceptions that it&rsquo;s spitting out whenever  it tries to spawn animals - the level provider is providing the wrong  chunk.</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;<br /><br />Cheers,<br />- R</p></blockquote>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/7799649091/sharing-an-interesting-email.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;7799649091&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

The chair is a lot more comfortable than I remember, and the office is overflowing with irony. While I was gone, we&rsquo;ve hired another graphics artist to help out with Scrolls, Mattis (<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2F%23%21%2Fbomuboi&amp;t=NGFkY2RlZDg1ZDg1ZGJjMjA0OGNkNzViNTllYTNmMjliMTkzNzIyZixUV25YRnV5VA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F6969771554%2Fback-in-the-office-and-some-words-on-17-and-18">@bomuboi</a> on twitter), and two more potential employees are being talked to. More news on that when we&rsquo;ve signed them.</p><p>Me and Jens have been independently working on stuff for the adventure update, and it&rsquo;s been growing in scope as we&rsquo;ve been working on it. That means it will take quite some time to finish, but that it will hopefully change the game a lot to the better. To prevent going too far between updates, we&rsquo;ve decided to release Pistons early.</p><p>That means 1.7 will be released soon, containing only pistons and probably a couple of bug fixes. The adventure update will take however long it takes, and will be released as 1.8. It might be a long wait, but it will be worth it!</p><p>After 1.8, we&rsquo;ll have to start crunching for the full release in November. That includes finishing up the mod api, improving stability and performance, adding supporting features like friends lists and a proper server browser, integrating singleplayer and multiplayer, and most importantly fleshing out the gameplay.</p><p>The release date is almost certainly changed to sometime the week after 11/11/11, and we&rsquo;re working hard on setting that up. We want to make a big spectacle out of the release where we involve fans and celebrate it properly.</p><p>Then we&rsquo;ll rest for a few weeks. Then I&rsquo;ll start working on the first post-release update. :D</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/6969771554/back-in-the-office-and-some-words-on-17-and-18.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;6969771554&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

E3 is over, and we&rsquo;re flying back to Sweden in a few hours. I have loads of information and news to share, so here&rsquo;s a rambling information dump:</p><p>* Minecraft fans are amazing. I spent a fair bit of time at E3 signing t-shirts and cardboard heads, trying to speak with as many fans as possible, and every single person was super friendly and nice.</p><p>* It looks like we need to change the release date for Minecraft to be able to get a good venue for MinecraftCon. 11/11/11 is fully booked. One week later, perhaps? I&rsquo;ll post more details as soon as we&rsquo;ve decided and booked a venue.</p><p>* Minecraft is coming to XBox 360. It will be a new version of the game, designed specifically for console play. We haven&rsquo;t decided on a name yet. It will feature (but not require) Kinect support, and is being released &ldquo;this winter&rdquo;. It will be a 360 exclusive title.</p><p>* Minecraft is coming to Xperia PLAY. It will be a new version of the game, designed specifically for mobile play. This version is called &ldquo;Minecraft - Pocket Edition&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s built as a native Android game, and will take full use of the Xperia PLAY controls. After some period of exclusivity, we will release it for all modern Android phones.</p><p>* On both these platforms, I&rsquo;m going to be more secretive about giving out details. This is because there are actual PR budgets on them, and I don&rsquo;t want to mess up any big plans.</p><p>* I will be the game designer on both new Minecraft titles, but I won&rsquo;t be involved in the programming as I&rsquo;m focused on the PC version of Minecraft.</p><p>* We are working on Minecraft Beta 1.7, which I&rsquo;m referring to as the &ldquo;adventure update&rdquo;. We&rsquo;re keeping the details secret so people can get surprises. The idea with this update is to flesh out the game a bit, making it reward exploration and combat more. Assuming we like them in play testing, pistons are coming in 1.7.</p><p>* I&rsquo;ve now been to the Playboy Mansion! Woo! Not related to Minecraft at all, but I just wanted to share that. :D</p><p>* Speaking of not Minecraft related, I got to see the Skyrim demo (thanks, Tim), and it&rsquo;s freaking amazing. While the dragons in the demo were obviously scripted (he knew exactly where they would land and such), they claim they&rsquo;re fully dynamic and unscripted in the full game.</p><p>* We&rsquo;re starting the modding support on a small scale with 1.7. We&rsquo;ll be giving the source code out to a very VERY small group of people before the release of 1.7. We&rsquo;ll use those experiences to work out the final details, then we&rsquo;ll get the modding api out as soon as possible after 1.7 has been released.</p><p>* Again, if you weren&rsquo;t ware, the &ldquo;modding api&rdquo; is the entire source code for Minecraft, uncensored and unobfuscated. You need to agree to certain terms to get access, though, but anyone can apply.</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/6385865216/post-e3-information-dump.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;6385865216&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

This setting is intended for people with laptops or graphics cards prone to overheat.</p><p>If the game doesn&rsquo;t have any pending chunk rebuilds, it will run uncapped.</p><p>This means that the framerate can be higher than the cap (except for in the 40 setting), but that it usually will be slightly lower than the cap because it&rsquo;s very difficult to tell ahead of time how long a chunk rebuild will take. I chose &ldquo;90&rdquo; as the default because it should usually end up with an framerate of just above 60 fps (good for people who play the game vsynched) and will let the game spend as much time as possible rebuilding chunks.</p><p>There is a bug currently with the limiter where it will often rebuild a minimum of two chunks per frame, which is twice as many as before.</p><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t at all mind adding a setting that works the way it did in the past, but I&rsquo;m worried people might think &ldquo;uncapped&rdquo; is automatically better. Some might prefer having daytime brightness changes happening faster, but not realize that they should run the game at a capped framerate.</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/5945205026/what-the-framerate-limiter-does.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;5945205026&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

I will be going through bug lists (including the great one on the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.minecraftwiki.net%2Fwiki%2FBugs&amp;t=ZjY3N2IxOTA2YjA5OWI3Nzk0Y2YwYjdlMjQyYTZhNjk2OTM0N2I4NixCd214c2NhRw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F4988431144%2Fthe-maps">Minecraft wiki</a>) and fixing as many as I can. There&rsquo;s no set date for the update yet as I don&rsquo;t know how long it&rsquo;ll take to go through the list.</p><p>The only new feature that will appear is the mapping.</p><p>When you craft a map, you will be able to somehow select how &ldquo;zoomed in&rdquo; you want the map to be. It will be centered on the location where you craft it, and it will fill in as you explore the land. If you go outside the edges of the map, it will stop updating, so each map is of a specific area. (like real maps!)</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of a fully zooomed in map (good for town maps, for example):</p><p><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkbo5m6Nr51qzb7ox.png" class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image"/></p><p>And here&rsquo;s a screenshot of a fully zoomed out map:</p><p><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkbnskYrcY1qzb7ox.png" class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image"/></p><p>If you drop a map and someone else picks it up, they will be able to see your progress. You will also be able to (somehow) CLONE maps so that two separate map items link to the same map data. That means you can see what other players carrying the same map explores, and both you and them will show up as blinking dots or similar on the maps.</p><p>Currently, the map will only update if you&rsquo;re holding it in your hands, but the map will kind of hide away when you&rsquo;re looking straight forward. To see the map properly, you have to look down, thisly:</p><p><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkboemxS9V1qzb7ox.png" class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image"/></p><p>Any changes you make to the terrain will show up on the maps, but only once someone carrying the map gets near that area. In other words, you won&rsquo;t magically get to see changes far away on the map.</p><p>At the moment the map doesn&rsquo;t work at all in multiplayer, but that&rsquo;s my next task. The code I write to support that will also be possible to reuse in the future for things like books and notes written by players, and possibly even custom paintings/hand drawn signs.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a hard limit of 65536 unique maps per world, though, and I don&rsquo;t think I can get around that without breaking the code very bad. I&rsquo;m trying to figure out if the limit is high enough or if I should spend the time rewriting the code..</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/4988431144/the-maps.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;4988431144&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

It&rsquo;s still a bit vague and the details might<br />change after we&rsquo;ve run it by our lawyers, but here&rsquo;s what we want to<br />do:<br /><br />* Let players sign up as &ldquo;mod developers&rdquo;. <strike>This will cost money</strike> (edit: no longer costs money!), and<br />will require you agreeing to a license deal (you only need one per<br />mod team). <br />* Mod developers can download the source code from our SVN repository.<br />As soon as we commit a change, it will be available to all mod<br />developers, unobfuscated and uncensored.<br />* Mod developers get a unique certificate for signing their mods. This<br />means players can see who made what mod and choose to trust individual<br />developers. The cost of signing up makes sure only serious developers<br />have access to this certificate.<br /><br />The rules of the license deal will contain:<br /><br />* Mods must only be playable by people who have bought Minecraft<br />* You can&rsquo;t sell your mods or make money off them unless you&rsquo;ve got a<br />separate license deal with us<br />* The mods must not be malicious (obviously)<br />* We retain the right to use your mod idea and implement it ourselves<br />in Minecraft. This is to prevent the situation where we have to avoid<br />adding a feature just because there&rsquo;s a mod out there that does<br />something similar. It&rsquo;s also great for dealing with bug fixes provided<br />by the community.<br /><br />In the long term, we hope this means people will do awesome new things<br />with the Minecraft engine and play around with it. We want to buy<br />and/or license good mods and/or total conversions and sell them<br />ourselves. It&rsquo;s possible we might have a mod marketplace for selling<br />and buying mods that fans have written, or we might purchase and<br />integrate nice mods that fit the main theme of Minecraft.</p><p>[edit:]</p><p>Just to clear up two things:</p><p>The access cost won&rsquo;t be prohibitively expensive, and if you make a good mod or something else based on the source code, it&rsquo;s highly likely we will want to license it.</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/4955141617/the-plan-for-mods.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;4955141617&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

It&rsquo;s Monday, and we&rsquo;ve got the day off for some reason. (Something about Easter) Me and ez took a short walk, and the weather was wonderful. :-D<br />But that&rsquo;s not what this blog post is about. It&rsquo;s about dumping a bunch of random information on you!</p><p>First of all, Jens got temporarily moved to a new project, so I&rsquo;m on my own on Minecraft for a while (not sure how long..). It feels scary, but he&rsquo;s right across the desk from me. Thank you for your work so far, Jens, I know both the community and I really appreciate all your hard work. :-D</p><p>Jens was working on integrating/tweaking the Piston mod, which will probably get delayed as a result of this. We don&rsquo;t want to just add it as-is because it doesn&rsquo;t quite feel &ldquo;fantasy&rdquo; enough, and there&rsquo;s a lot of corner cases we need to solve.</p><p>Last week, I started playing around with minimaps, and Vraket from <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oxeyegames.com%2F&amp;t=MDNlNTg0Y2Y2MTA1YTU3MGFhODhiM2E0NWY4ZmI5OTQyYjg0NGU1YixCY09tZldXSA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F4928142990%2Finformation-dump-again">Oxeye games</a> took some interest in it. We played around with it for a while, and it kinda got more and more ambitious as we went. Now it&rsquo;s a proper mapping tool! You make a map, and it starts out empty. As you move around, you fill in parts of the map automatically (as long as the map is being held). You can give the map to other people and they will see what you&rsquo;ve explored on there, and it&rsquo;s quite possible you will even be able to magically &ldquo;link&rdquo; two maps so they&rsquo;re the same map. That means you will be able to see where other people who carry the same map are.</p><p>Vraket is a game design genius, btw.</p><p>One slightly bad news item is that I&rsquo;m starting to get second thoughts about the modding API. People are already doing great mods, and there&rsquo;s no way we&rsquo;d be able to make an API good and dynamic enough to support all of the awesome things people are making. I still very much want modding to be a part of Minecraft, but I&rsquo;m not convinced spending months writing an API that won&rsquo;t satisfy people is the correct way to do so. There probably are better ways to do it.<br />The main problems we need to solve are preventing people from making money off our work (unless they have a license deal with us), and making sure mods don&rsquo;t break with each game update. People obviously already CAN make mods, so the ability to make them isn&rsquo;t the biggest priority.<br />Hmm.</p><p>Oh, oh, oh, and we also passed two million sales! That&rsquo;s HUUGE, and as usual I&rsquo;m not quite sure how to deal with it! We&rsquo;ve got a company dinner planned for Thursday night, and I plan on getting Jakob drunk. That would be fun.</p><p>And [at some point in the near future], we&rsquo;ve got our office house warming party! It&rsquo;s a bit late since we moved in like half a year ago, but the renovations and new decorations should finally be done by then. The guest list is pretty long, but Carl assures us there&rsquo;s room for everyone.</p><p>There&rsquo;s one final piece of information that I&rsquo;d love to share, but I&rsquo;m not allowed to. I&rsquo;ll just say I&rsquo;m very excited about it :D</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/4928142990/information-dump-again.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;4928142990&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

We had it at a nice asian restaurant, and there was food, drinks and coffee. Carl held a nice presentation, showing the progress of the company, and we discussed and voted about various details on where to go and what to do. The most relevant parts for Minecraft is that we decided to bring in bug fixing into the development method in a more clear way so that people working customer support can add them as tasks for us, and that we finally set a release date for Minecraft.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a bit tricky to really do a release for Minecraft as we keep updating it all the time. For one, the version we deem as the &ldquo;full version&rdquo; won&rsquo;t be very different at all from what the game was like a week ago, and we&rsquo;ll keep adding features after the release as well, so it&rsquo;s really more of a milestone when we finally get rid of the Beta label, and some kind of goal for us to work towards. The plan is to be open with this and try to get people to cheer us on as much as possible, but to be open with the fact that the game won&rsquo;t change much at the actual release day. (It&rsquo;s more a progress up until that point)</p><p>We picked November 11, with the unofficial tagline &ldquo;us too&rdquo;.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the same date as a few other games and movies, and the one I&rsquo;m the most excited about is Skyrim, so that will be a nice reward for me if we actually manage to hit that date!</p><p>And, in case you want an update on Minecraft:</p><p>We&rsquo;ve been working on finishing up Achievements and Statistics for 1.5, I ran into some issues with JSON, got frustrated, and added weather instead. Developing new features like that is what I enjoy doing the most, so I ended up covering a lot of ground. There&rsquo;s periodic downfall (snow in snowy areas, rain in others, nothing in deserts) that make the sky darker, hides the sun, moon and stars, and makes everything wet. Ice grows back in cold regions, and snowfall covers the ground when it&rsquo;s snowing. During rain/snow, there can be occasional thunderstorms with lightning. I haven&rsquo;t finished the actual lightning bolt yet, but everything else is fairly done.<br />Once the stats are done and the weather has been tested through, we&rsquo;ll release 1.5. I&rsquo;m guessing this will be next week. The piston mod might get added, but it will not be in time for 1.5.</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/4423138657/111111.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;4423138657&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

I thought about it, and realized that I only feel like I have the time to blog when I&rsquo;m being prevented from doing actual development. So I guess in one sense, the recent lull in updates can be seen as a good thing. ;) Hopefully it doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ve grown tired of blogging..</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been able to focus on development a lot the last couple of weeks, and we&rsquo;re hoping to get the new update out soon. It will include the wolves, the ability to change your spawn point, and a rather ambitious statistics tracking and achievement system. Once that update is out, we&rsquo;ll spend some time figuring out exactly what to do with the modding, which should result in a nice modding API.</p><p>Other cool news is that work has started on the mobile version of Minecraft, we landed a <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.minecraft.net%2Fmerch.jsp&amp;t=ZmFjNzU4ZjdmZmVmYjVlZGE4MWIwODIxMzQ2MDhkYzEwM2RlNGQ3YSxNRzlMenNOZg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F4159257708%2Ffull-steam-ahead-captain">merchandise deal with J!NX</a> (pardon the plug), the guys working on Scrolls decided to use Scrum with internal demos each Tuesday, the office renovations are almost complete, and 2 Player Productions reached their goal on kickstarter to make a full-length movie about Mojang!

As a result, we haven&rsquo;t been able to work from the office this week, and worked from home. Jens spent most of the week working on a new mob; the wolf! You can tame it and order it to follow you around, and it&rsquo;ll work as a pet. They&rsquo;re fairly rare, but they won&rsquo;t despawn once you&rsquo;ve tamed them.</p><p>I worked on the achievement and stats system. One design issue was dealing with offline mode and synching the achievements once you get a connection again, but that&rsquo;s been solved. We&rsquo;ve got a couple of people in the office who don&rsquo;t like achievements in games at all, so the goal is to design something that they&rsquo;re fine with.</p><p>Achievements will NOT be chores like &ldquo;cut down 10000 trees&rdquo;, but rather challenges like &ldquo;ride a pig off a cliff&rdquo;. Stats, however, will be used to keep track of how many trees you have cut down. The long term plan is to show achievements and stats from the profile page on minecraft.net as well, in case you want to brag.</p><p>Just keep in mind that because you can design your own levels and run your own servers, people will be able to cheat with achievements and stats! ;)</p><p>Oh, and here&rsquo;s a vid of the wolves: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dc9Lp9p5yjuo&amp;t=YmZiNDMzODU2MDc2ZWRhYTRjOGZiOTAzNzA5OGQ5ZTRiMWQzYjhiNCxyeGo4bXdQUA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F3940195633%2Fthe-state-of-minecraft">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9Lp9p5yjuo</a></p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/3940195633/the-state-of-minecraft.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;3940195633&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

I&rsquo;m on a tiny airplane now, though, with nowhere to run, so here we go!</p><p>One of the most complex parts of Minecraft is the terrain generation. When I changed the game over from being just single zones of a map to an infinite map, the terrain generation got a whole lot more complicated, as terrain needs to get generated on the fly as the player explores, and it has to be the same no matter what direction the player approaches it from.</p><p><strong>1) How infinite is it?</strong></p><p>First of all, let me clarify some things about the &ldquo;infinite&rdquo; maps: They&rsquo;re not infinite, but there&rsquo;s no hard limit either. It&rsquo;ll just get buggier and buggier the further out you are. Terrain is generated, saved and loaded, and (kind of) rendered in chunks of 16*16*128 blocks. These chunks have an offset value that is a 32 bit integer roughly in the range negative two billion to positive two billion. If you go outside that range (about 25% of the distance from where you are now to the sun), loading and saving chunks will start overwriting old chunks. At a 16/th of that distance, things that use integers for block positions, such as using items and pathfinding, will start overflowing and acting weird.</p><p>Those are the two &ldquo;hard&rdquo; limits.</p><p>Most other things, like the terrain generation seeds and entity locations use 64 bit doubles for locations, and they do much subtler things. For example, at extreme distances, the player may move slower than near the center of the world, due to rounding errors (the position has a huge mantissa, the movement delta has a tiny, so it gets cut off faster). The terrain generator can also start generating weird structures, such as huge blocks of solid material, but I haven&rsquo;t seen this lately nor examined exactly what behavior causes it to happen. One major problem at long distances is that the physics starts bugging out, so the player can randomly fall into ground blocks or get stuck while walking along a wall.</p><p>Many of these problems can be solved by changing the math into a local model centered around the player so the numbers all have vaguely the same magnitude. For rendering, Minecraft already uses local coordinates within the block and offset the block position relative to the player to give the impression of the player moving. This is mostly due to OpengGL using 32 bit floats for positions, but also because the rounding errors are extremely visible when displayed on a screen.</p><p>We&rsquo;re probably not going to fix these bugs until it becomes common for players to experience them while playing legitimately. My gut feeling is that nobody ever has so far, and nobody will. Walking that far will take a very long time. Besides, the bugs add mystery and charisma to the Far Lands.</p><p><strong>2) Isn&rsquo;t that terrain shape pretty awesome?</strong></p><p>In the very earliest version of Minecraft, I used a 2D Perlin noise heightmap to set the shape of the world. Or, rather, I used quite a few of them. One for overall elevation, one for terrain roughness, and one for local detail. For each column of blocks, the height was (elevation + (roughness*detail))*64+64. Both elevation and roughness were smooth, large scale noises, and detail was a more intricate one. This method had the great advantage of being very fast as there&rsquo;s just 16*16*(noiseNum) samples per chunk to generate, but the disadvantage of being rather dull. Specifically, there&rsquo;s no way for this method to generate any overhangs.</p><p>So I switched the system over into a similar system based off 3D Perlin noise. Instead of sampling the &ldquo;ground height&rdquo;, I treated the noise value as the &ldquo;density&rdquo;, where anything lower than 0 would be air, and anything higher than or equal to 0 would be ground. To make sure the bottom layer is solid and the top isn&rsquo;t, I just add the height (offset by the water level) to the sampled result.</p><p>Unfortunately, I immediately ran into both performance issues and playability issues. Performance issues because of the huge amount of sampling needed to be done, and playability issues because there were no flat areas or smooth hills. The solution to both problems turned out to be just sampling at a lower resolution (scaled 8x along the horizontals, 4x along the vertical) and doing a linear interpolation. Suddenly, the game had flat areas, smooth hills, and also most single floating blocks were gone.</p><p>The exact formula I use is a bit involved (and secret!), but it evolved slowly over time as I worked on the game. It still uses the 2D elevation and noisyness maps, though.</p><p><strong>STILL TO COME, ON TERRAIN GENERATION:</strong></p><ul><li>Biomes!</li><li>Caves and Large Features</li><li>Trees, Lakes, and Small Features</li><li>The nether!</li></ul><p>Now I&rsquo;ll prepare for landing so I can switch flights!</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/3746989361/terrain-generation-part-1.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;3746989361&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">
