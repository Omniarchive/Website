Garcia plays a prison guard with secret acting ambitions. He  decides to house a criminal without telling him or the rest of the family  that he is his father. I kept laughing along with the rest of the audience  during this film which made it a good movie experience. Although the  care-for-your-loved-ones-and-don&rsquo;t-lie-too-much point is nothing new,  this film manages to tell it well.</p><p>Worst part: Garcia does a Marlon  Brandon impersonation.</p><p>Best part: The youngest son&rsquo;s  never ending blunt honesty at the dinner table.</p><p>4/5</p><p><b>Together</b> <a target="_blank" href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt1324056%2F&amp;t=YzdkNWE2OTRjOTdiZjQ1NDZiNmRkODhkZDkyMjQ3NGNhNDAyMDE5NixCamFDdUFWOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F264019619%2Ffilm-festival-reviews-part-11">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1324056/</a></p><p>This is a film about how a  family can be torn apart by loss. It also shows very well an egocentric  childish mind at work. I was moved by some scenes but the film has now  faded away and proves not to be that memorable. The every day life is  very good portrayed and the psychology is interesting. It&rsquo;s refreshing  to see a film where people are put to harm but where noone is really  evil. Most people do mean well.</p><p>Worst part: When the father  fails to make pizza dough - it&rsquo;s exaggerated.</p><p>Best part: The sudden turn  in the beginning of the movie.

The film is smart and intense and although full of violence never  gets too brutal as many films in this genre.

He repeatedly repents for his sins, but keeps ruling with an iron fist because he either feels he has to or because he&rsquo;s just plain insane. In the start of his movie, he appoints his old friend (who is now a monk) as the new <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMetropolitan_bishop&amp;t=YWQ1MTVhNDdiZDZlNDY5NTA4MGM1MmVhMzYwMWY5ODdjOWI3MmJhOSxTa05YeTJWRQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F259393291%2Ffilm-festival-reviews-part-10">Metropolitan</a> after the old one had left to live at a monastery.<br />The two friends spend pretty much the rest of the movie trying to convince each other either to forgive and be kind or that violence and strictness is needed to rule a nation. That&rsquo;s two hours of Russian men kissing each others bearded cheeks and talking about god&rsquo;s will.<br />Mixed in with these are some scenes from a battle in Poland, a few religious near-miracles, and a fascinating young orphan child.<br />When I saw this movie, a guy in the audience kept laughing at things that really weren&rsquo;t supposed to be funny. When the Metropolitan told the Tsar that he was the guily one and that he was the one that should be judged, the Tsar replied &ldquo;I forgive you. Judge yourself&rdquo;, and the guy laughed. Sure, what the Tsar said was kinda witty and quick and a mean way of passively agressively punishing someone, but when you laugh at someone that powerful and deranged, you really undermine the entire feel of the movie for everyone else in the room.</p><p>Best part: When the Tsar gets dressed after having prayed, at the start of the movie.<br />Worst part: The opening scene of the fourth act felt very out of place.<br />Score: 4/5</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/259393291/film-festival-reviews-part-10.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;259393291&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

Part 9.</div><p><b>Dogtooth</b></p><p>Two parents keep their children away from society, tricking them into believing that the world outside is dangerous and that the only safe way to leave is by car. The father takes the car to work every day, and brings back food and other things they need. The disinformation they feed the children is a great source of comedy, and that&rsquo;s good since the rest of the movie is pretty intense and bleak. All sides of humanity (even if repressed and disturbing) are shown in fairly graphic detail.<br />I found it both shocking and refreshing to see both violence and sexuality shown on screen. Usually only violence gets shown, but sexuality gets hidden and only hinted at to the level where we as an audience find even images of bare breasts to be risque.<br />Either this is a result of American values dominating cinema because of the success of Hollywood, or it&rsquo;s simply a result of most people not being violent so it&rsquo;s easier to escape into fantasies of violence that one would never act upon than to escape into sexual themes which are much truer to what one really is like.<br />Who knows?<br />Just don&rsquo;t bring your mother to this movie.<br />The actual plot itself feels secondary. The movie tries to make a comment on something I don&rsquo;t quite understand (even despite hearing the director comment on it after the movie in a face to face), and it ends up feeling a bit over the top and weird. It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re expected NOT to get the movie. (Which, btw, is why I can&rsquo;t stand David Lynch) I much prefer it when there&rsquo;s something to get, but it&rsquo;s well hidden.</p><p>Best part: The Elder!

Nine more movies to go, of which six are this weekend.</i></p><p><b>Fantastic Mr. Fox</b></p><p>Being based on the book by Roald Dahl, this movie has a very fantastic feel to it. Everything is quick and silly and over the top. Sometimes the pacing reminds a bit of a Pixar movie with things happening in quick succession.<br />The movie is beatifully animated with stop motion, even though it doesn&rsquo;t look as clean as other stop motion movies like Nightmare Before Christmas. There&rsquo;s an almost experimental feel to the movie, with stiff walk animations and fur randomly changing place between frames, but it only helps to bring out the fun. Children stories SHOULD be experimental.<br />George Clooney plays Mr. Fox, but feels a bit out of place. There&rsquo;s a slight disconnect between the voice we hear and the character we see on the screen. The rest of the cast are spot on. Bill Murray plays the Badger perfectly. This is the third movie I&rsquo;ve seen with Bill Murray in in just three weeks. I thought he was taking a break from acting?</p><p>Best part: The digging animation cracked me up every time I saw it.<br />Worst part: Mr. Fox&rsquo;s trademark, a whiste and some clicking sound, was just annoying.<br />Score: 4/5</p><p><b>Extract</b></p><p>After having run a flavor extract factory and business for many years, the owner gets a chance to sell his company and retire. Then a bunch of very entertaining, but loosely related stuff happens and everyone laughs.<br />Mike Judge, who made this movie, isn&rsquo;t exactly known for making coherent movies. Beavis and Butthead Do America was good but random, Office Space was <i>great</i> but random, and Idiocracy was just plain bad. Extract has some separate threads going that coincide with each others at points, but it manages to feel more like Office Space than Idiocracy.<br />Ben Affleck, who I&rsquo;ve never seen do anything even close to good acting, plays the best and funniest role in the movie. I&rsquo;m not sure if this means that the rest are bad, or that Ben finally felt comfortable with a role.<br />And, great surprise: In this movie, David Koechner plays an annoying, kind of dumb, shouty guy. It&rsquo;s still funny, though.</p><p>Best part: The last gag in the movie was by far the best. Subtle and crude at the same time. Perfect.<br />Worst part: One of the characters suddenly acts waaay out of character for no explained reason, other than pure plot convenience.<br />Score: 4/5</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/256177192/film-festival-reviews-part-8.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;256177192&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

They go to a part with some very open minded and artistic people and start discussing shooting a porn movie for an upcoming porn/art festival called Humpfest. They all agree (while drunk) that a porno movie where two straight guys have sex would be very groundbreaking and artistic, so they decide to do so on Saturday.<br />During the next days, they struggle with their promise, struggle with their own self-image of who they think they are, and with telling Married Guy&rsquo;s wife about their plans. It&rsquo;s all very hilarious, very honest, and very realistic. I ended up caring a lot about the characters, thanks to very competent and subtle acting. A lot got said in just small changes of expression.<br />Last year, I saw <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBaghead&amp;t=MjA0NDNjOGFmOWYyMzY4NTEzMWMwN2U4NjUxNjllYzgwNTZiMDEwMyxYUXlnQzZ4eQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F254130223%2Ffilm-festival-reviews-part-7">Baghead</a> at the Film Festival, and I really loved it. This movie was quite similar in style to that movie, and it turns out that the director of Baghead stars in Humpday, so I assume it&rsquo;s a similar group of people who made this movie, seeing as how both are small independent films.</p><p>I&rsquo;m telling you, keep an eye out for these people.</p><p>Best part: Soo much charisma and fine subtle acting makes you really feel like you&rsquo;re a part of what&rsquo;s happening.<br />Worst part: The scene where his wife found out, while hilarously funny, felt every so slightly fake.<br />Score: 5/5</p><p><b>World&rsquo;s Greatest Dad</b></p><p>Robin Williams plays a teacher who spends his free time raising his son and writing novels. His great dream is to get published, but he&rsquo;s never gotten anything published so far despite having written several novels.<br />His son goes to the school he teaches at, and is egoistic, rude and has a twisted sexuality. For example, early on in the movie, Robin&rsquo;s character catches him choking himself with a belt while masturbating.<br />The acting was average, the plot was unlikely, and Robin kept injecting his small cute little jokes (&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come over and put my penis in your vagina.

Still, this is the best movie of the festival so far.</p><p>Bart&rsquo;s been killed while serving military duty, and the movie starts out with his funeral. There&rsquo;s some fast and funny dialogue to set the tone of the movie, which is intelligent and funny. Then Bart wakes up, and he doesn&rsquo;t feel well. He crawls out from his grave and goes to see his friend, who obviously is shocked to see him. In what is probably the best scene in the movie, Bart tries to convince his friend that he really is there, and that he really is dead, and that he won&rsquo;t hurt him.<br />Accepting just single unbelievable event (him being undead), the rest of the movie feels very realistic. That initial meeting is probably very similar to how people would react in real life, and Barts reaction to being undead feels very believable. It&rsquo;s very refreshing to see a &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; zombie movie like this, even if it&rsquo;s primarily a (quite funny) comedy.<br />There are a few scenes which i feel step too far away from the realism for the sake of what I assume is satire, but overall it&rsquo;s more or less perfect. And the gore is beautiful.</p><p>Best part: I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this. Wow.<br />Worst part: A drawn out and unrealistic sequence of several innocent people dying. Fortunately, the rest of the movie is much more accessible.<br />Score: 5/5</p><p><b>White Lightning</b></p><p>I think for artistic reasons, this movie has the saturation turned way down, almost to the point of being black and white, is shot in 4:3 ratio, and has very grainy photography. The entire movie is narrated by the main character, who we get to follow from his troubled childhood up to the current day as he tries to explain why he&rsquo;s recently murdered several people. The tone of the movie is interesting, as most of the world in the movie feels relatively good and wholesome while the main character repeatedly seeks out the worst, abusing drugs and being violent.<br />He claims there&rsquo;s an evil in his blood, and that he tries to stop it. But it mostly seems like he&rsquo;s just trying to sabotage for himself as much as he can.<br />Carrie Fisher plays a part in this movie, which was a bit surprising.</p><p>Best part: The actor who played the narrator as a child was very good.<br />Worst part: A bit inaccessible due to being too &ldquo;artsy&rdquo;, and too long winded.<br />Score: 2/5</p><p>(Initially, I thought it was a 1/5 when I first saw it.

We follow the lives of several people as they struggle with personal problems and romance, and finally get to see everything get washed away by huge waves. The movie is similar in tone to <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FThe_Host_%2528film%2529&amp;t=MjcxNjdhNGQyMjE0M2Y5ZTQ1YWEwZTllOGY5M2ZkMWJhZTVmNjY2MCxoMTdVRjNidA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F253463321%2Ffilm-festival-reviews-part-4">The Host</a>, relying on comedy, but still treating serious matters with a sense of respect and urgency, avoiding pure slapstick (although there&rsquo;s plenty of that).<br />The acting is good, but almost every single character in the movie plays a comedic part at at least one point in the movie, so they all feel a bit hollow, making you care less about them when the disaster hits.<br />But you DO care about the disaster. It&rsquo;s very well made, and drawn out, and rewarding. There&rsquo;s much destruction without focusing too much on the loss of human lives (there&rsquo;s almost no blood in the movie), and I will remember one action sequence in particular for a long time.</p><p>Best part: The entire movie fits together really well.

She spends the rest of the movie looking for him and seeing things, maybe.<br />A lot of effort is put into establishing some kind of &ldquo;atmosphere&rdquo;, with clips of waves crashing being played backwards, and children being seen playing behind rocks, but vanishing magically.<br />I utterly despise tricks like that. Repeatedly forcing the audience to guess what&rsquo;s real or not is a very good sign that the movie is crap.<br />And Hierro is crap.<br />Oh, and there&rsquo;s a double twist ending that makes no sense at all.</p><p>Best part: Err..

The idea was kinda vaguely to make a spiritual sequel to <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mojang.com%2Fnotch%2Fj4k%2Fl4kd%2F&amp;t=NGU4YjEyODZhMjhlNmQ1ZGZkYTRlZGM5NjE5YmEwNjUyOTljOTc0ZSw3cmw0algwaA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F227922045%2Fthe-origins-of-minecraft">Left 4k Dead</a>.<br />It looked a little something like this: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D9Vmy-ZNbGXE&amp;t=N2RkNjZmMmQ4N2RkNGZkYTRiMTA0ZTA4OTE5MGEyNDg0MzQ2NzhiMyw3cmw0algwaA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F227922045%2Fthe-origins-of-minecraft">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Vmy-ZNbGXE</a></p><p>As the RubyDung engine got more advanced, I started thinking about adding a first person view for following your minions around, kinda like in <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D96kOS8rSavY&amp;t=NTIwNjBkMzAyNTk0MTY3YmE1OTE4MDdjOWNjMmI0MmY2Mzk1NGIyOCw3cmw0algwaA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F227922045%2Fthe-origins-of-minecraft">Dungeon Keeper</a>.

My god, I realized that that was the game I wanted to do. I played it in multiplayer for a while and had a blast, but found it flawed. Building was fun, but there wasn&rsquo;t enough variation, and the big red/blue blocks were pretty horrible. I thought a fantasy game in that style would work really really well, so I tried to implement a simple first person engine in that style, reusing some art and code (although not as much as you&rsquo;d think) from RubyDung, and came up with this:</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DF9t3FREAZ-k&amp;t=OWZiZTVlNzQ1ODk2Y2I2MzRmNTdiNmIxMWViMWJjM2UyMDk3NDg0OSw3cmw0algwaA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F227922045%2Fthe-origins-of-minecraft">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9t3FREAZ-k</a></p><p>The response was very positive, and I was blown away at how good the framerate, and how well it ran in a browser, so I decided to go for it. I knew I didn&rsquo;t want the flat sprite look of enemies that Infiniminer had, but I also knew I wasn&rsquo;t a good enough artist to make anything that looked really good. Additionally, realistic looking models would clash horribly with the terrain.</p><p>Then I realized I had already made fairly cool looking player models when i did ZombieTown, so I spend some time porting them to OpenGL, and ended up with this:</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mojang.com%2Fnotch%2Fminecraft%2Fscreen0.jpg&amp;t=MGFmY2U5YzFjYTA5ZTMxZjA2Y2MwNTQ4OTY5ZDkwOGMxNDFmZDAyNCw3cmw0algwaA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F227922045%2Fthe-origins-of-minecraft">http://www.mojang.com/notch/minecraft/screen0.jpg</a></p><p>And that&rsquo;s where we are now.</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/227922045/the-origins-of-minecraft.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;227922045&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

You can play it here: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fjayisgames.com%2Fcgdc6%2F%3FgameID%3D9&amp;t=ZjRlOWM1MDc2NWMzNmZjMDhiYjY3MDc3MzhiMjEzM2Y0ZDRiNzc1ZCxxU1FqM0p4bQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F225791202%2Freview-small-worlds">http://jayisgames.com/cgdc6/?gameID=9</a></p><p>You play as a 1x3 pixel guy in a space station, trying to find a way to escape the noise. There are no enemies, no way of dying, and all you can do is walk and jump. It quickly becomes obvious that the main star here isn&rsquo;t the main character at all, but rather the level design, which gradually is revealed to you as you explore.</p><p>As the player walks around, he lights up/reveals the area near him, and the screen zooms out to keep the entire explored area visible at all times, so at the start of a level, all you see is a small room with a huge column of pixels. Towards the end of a level, you&rsquo;ve got nice pixellated artwork revealed with a tiny man running around it.</p><p>And the levels are beautiful. There&rsquo;s a noise/canvas overlay to the pixels, breaking the normally hard feel of pixel graphics, and the animations are perfect, with blinking lights, running water and a few nice surprises. It really becomes a challenge in itself to try to reveal the entire level. It&rsquo;s just too pretty to leave unrevealed.</p><p>The <i>actual</i> goal of the game, however, isn&rsquo;t immediately clear. It&rsquo;s only after some exploring that you start to figure out what to do, and the game goes from being just pretty to being more interesting narratively (although there is no text in the game).</p><p>However, there are some issues. The level design is a bit rude, with plenty of dead ends and one way drops that take you back a bit too far. On one level, you could see the goal immediately, but still were forced to take the longest route possible to get there. I found that quite frustrating, and if took away a lot of the fun of exploring. I felt like the game was intentionally trying to squeeze out as much time from me as possible on that level instead of letting me figure out how to get there.</p><p>The dead-ends are often pretty obvious to figure out before hand, but I still found myself entering them in an attempt to reveal as much as possible of the level. But unfortunately, there were a few black areas in some level that I wasn&rsquo;t able to reveal. It would&rsquo;ve been nice if it was possible to reveal every single pixel in each level, and possibly to have some kind of reward for revealing an entire level.</p><p>Unfortunately, I wasn&rsquo;t able to play with music or sound effects enabled, so I can&rsquo;t comment on those.</p><p>Play the game. It won&rsquo;t take long, and it&rsquo;s a lovely experience.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fjayisgames.com%2Fcgdc6%2F%3FgameID%3D9&amp;t=ZjRlOWM1MDc2NWMzNmZjMDhiYjY3MDc3MzhiMjEzM2Y0ZDRiNzc1ZCxxU1FqM0p4bQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F225791202%2Freview-small-worlds">http://jayisgames.com/cgdc6/?gameID=9</a></p><p>(Just try to ignore the ads and corporate logos, which kinda spoils it a bit)</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/225791202/review-small-worlds.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;225791202&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

With creative mode (which is the same, but no health and no arrows, and a different inventory), I get 500.
