I had played a lot of TF and TFC back in the day, and I knew TF2 would be the greatest thing ever. My friends humored me and got it on the beta with me. And my god was it awesome. It was awesomer than awesome!</p><p>Way later, I went through this period of not really enjoying TF2 as much as I had. After spending hundreds of hours on a game, I guess that&rsquo;s bound to happen.</p><p>A while back, I started playing it a bit now and again to see what was new. And it scared me a bit. The game I remembered with sentries glitched under the floor and sidecrits wasn&rsquo;t there. Now it was all swords and space guns and engineers protecting spots nobody was playing anywhere near. But something was there. It was still fun.</p><p>Then I got invited to play in the third TF2 Mixup (<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tf2mixup.com%2Fmatch%2FMixup3&amp;t=MTY5MDdhN2RkOGE3MTQ1MGM1OGFhNmI4OTk5YWMxOGU5MTlhNDA3OSxwZjJJSGZteQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F13353738451%2Fi-love-team-fortress-2">watch it here</a>) with a bunch of famous TF2 personalities. Robin Walker, my third favorite person at Valve, was there, and kept killing me with his super hax. And by golly did I have a great time!</p><p>So I kept playing, and I kept having fun. Playing with ez in the other room is lots of fun, and the game seems to for some reason have gotten a lot easier since it went free to play. Ahem. I got the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.teamfortress.com%2Fwiki%2FPrimeval_warrior&amp;t=YmFjMjZmYTYwMWNlMDc4MTMzOTU1NTM1OGM1NmM0ZDA1Y2U5ZTc0MCxwZjJJSGZteQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F13353738451%2Fi-love-team-fortress-2">Primeval Warrior</a> after a while, and felt special.</p><p>Then I got <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.teamfortress.com%2Fwiki%2FTop_Notch&amp;t=M2RlZDU0ZDJhYWQxZmJhZDJiNWJlYzE5ZjRlYmE4ZDU2ODFhZjI1NyxwZjJJSGZteQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F13353738451%2Fi-love-team-fortress-2">this</a>:</p><p><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lva2o4E3we1qzb7ox.png" class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image"/></p><p>Hooooly cow.

Celsius and Fahrenheit are silly.</div><p>Some time many years ago, we decided to measure something that has a zero value on a scale where zero isn&rsquo;t at the zero value. A temperature of <em>no heat at all</em> is -273 and -460 in degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit respectively. This makes no sense. None.</p><p>In Kelvin, a total lack of heat is exactly 0 K. This makes sense. The lack of distance is exactly 0 meters. And 0 yards. And 0 parsecs.</p><p>So the obvious solution is to either switch everyone over to Kelvin (or Rankine if you&rsquo;re a hipster), or to change introduce a new measurement for distance that has the zero point at some other value than <em>no distance at all</em>.</p><p>I suggest the Flen, based off the human body. 0 Flen is exactly 1.76 meters, because that happens to be my length. 1 Flen is 2.76 meters. -1.76 Flen is 0 meters, or a total lack of distance.</p><p>Some measurements in Flen:<br />Diameter of CD-Rom: -1.64 Flen<br />Length of Notch: 0 Flen<br />Length of Jakob: 0.02 Flen<br />Height of Eiffel Tower: 322.4 Flen</p><p>Who&rsquo;s with me?</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/13170951247/kelvin-is-awesome-celsius-and-fahrenheit-are.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;13170951247&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

People were looking tired, but happy, and me and Jakob had bacon with far too much Tabasco sauce on. Then I went and did an interview with CNN, finishing with playing some Minecraft next to a fan. I went back to signing stuff for two hours.</p><p>Then there was the charity lunch. The food was excellent, and everyone there had paid a lot of money that later got donated to the Make A Wish Foundation. I ended up signing even more stuff at that lunch.</p><p>After lunch, I did an interview with Machinima, followed by me heading over the backstage area of the closing session thing. I got even more things to sign there, for IGN and something else I forget what it was. The closing session got delayed 20 minutes due to total chaos, but we eventually got on stage and thanked everyone for coming, thanked the sponsors, gave away a huge fake check to Make A Wish, and brought a guy and his girlfriend up on stage for a proposal.

Confusion started setting in until someone figured it out. Breakfast in the USA apparently consisted of cake bread with peanut butter and jam, and extremely crispy bacon. I am not complaining.</p><p>We went to rehearse the opening session, and I got mic:ed up by what I think was CNN, who are filming something about something. I tried to pay attention, but so much was going on, I kinda faked understanding what was happening. There was a big minecraft lever on stage that I had to pull, timed to a snare drum / bass drum kick in a song. I couldn&rsquo;t pull it too hard, or it would pop out, as it wasn&rsquo;t actually held in place by anything other than pressure from the material on the sides of it.</p><p>We had lunch backstage, I had some refreshing beverages to soothe my nerves, and then fans started filling the room for the opening ceremony. Thousands of them. My personal security guard (provided by the hotel) also arrived. His job is to help me get from place to place when I need to go somewhere without getting mobbed, and to make sure I&rsquo;m &ldquo;safe&rdquo;. Turns out he&rsquo;s been a cop for many years, so he had awesome authority just by looking at people. He&rsquo;s done stuff like this for a long time.</p><p>The opening ceremony went well. We started with an opening trailer by Hat Films, watched a video by Captain Sparkles, listened to Stuart Platt from Microsoft who showed the Minecraft Xbox 360 trailer (also made by Hat Films), listened to Daniel talk about the iOS version, then we introduced everyone at Mojang. Then Mega64 came on and played their Minecraft 1.0 release funny video type of thing. It was funny :D. I got to be mocked by Rocco, which has been a goal of mine for a long time.</p><p>I got a standing ovation when I came on stage. There&rsquo;s no way to deal with that. Emotions ran wild. Then I did a short talk, then we pulled the lever, and I ran off to watch my sister get married, Vegas style.</p><p>After the wedding, we had the Mojang Panel where the Oxeye team talked about Cobalt, the Scrolls team talked about Scrolls, then everyone from Mojang answered questions from the audience. Or rather, Jakob, Mattis, Jens and I answered questions. The rest mostly just sat there. ;)</p><p>A quick snack later, we went to the main expo hall and sat down in the signing/taking pictures area, and spent a total of three hours signing stuff as fast as we could. It was absolutely crazy, with the queue leading all the way around the hall, out the doors, and all the way over to the stairs. Since we had to cut the line when we started running out of time, the volunteers handed out tickets for everyone who couldn&rsquo;t reach the front in time. We&rsquo;ll have a special signing session just for them today at 11 am.</p><p>We ended the night in our common Media Suite, where there was food and drinks. I didn&rsquo;t last long before leaving for bed.</p><p>Then I slept.</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/13013058362/day-3-the-launch.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;13013058362&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

I lingered in bed for three hours or so, but never managed to go back to sleep. Too many thoughts, too much jetlag. The sunset was very beautiful from our hotel room. At about 7 am or so, Elin and I called our family members, and we all gathered in our suite before going down to eat breakfast. And let me tell you, breakfast buffets in Vegas are pretty darn awesome.</p><p>Then I did some gambling and met some fans. So far I&rsquo;m up $130, all on slot machines. My plan is to either gamble all of that winning away or stop if I happen to hit $1000. I fully expect to lose it.</p><p>Everyone from Mojang met up at noon to go through the convention center. I got lost several times over while doing so, so I don&rsquo;t actually remember where anything of it was. But it sure was starting to look impressive. Someone told me that Minecraft for iOS had accidentally been released early and that it was the second most grossing app. The original plan was to reveal it as a secret thing during the opening ceremony. A bit later, it was the top grossing app.</p><p>I spend 45 minutes streaming the preparations to twitch.tv. I would stream more during the event, but we&rsquo;ve asked ign to be our exclusive streaming partner, and I don&rsquo;t want to do anything they&rsquo;re not ok with. If I see them, I will ask, and perhaps do some more streaming today.</p><p>We did a rehearsal press event thing, then the actual press event thing. I did a few interviews that got progressively more silly as the day went on. Most of the Yogscast interview was spent talking about Simon&rsquo;s mother, and I slapped myself twice during the one with Hat Films.</p><p>Then a few of us gathered in our suite again to get some room service, and ended up ordering way too much food. The nachos were awesome. Then I called Carl and cancelled the final thing I was supposed to do that day (record some video with &lt;SECRET&gt;) and fell asleep.</p><p>When I woke up, I heard we got a 10/10 review for Minecraft from Eurogamer. <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Farticles%2F2011-11-18-minecraft-review&amp;t=ZTU4NmE0ZGQ4YzdiOGEzMGZiYWY2YmRjMzYxMDU3YTJmYjBmYWJkOSxCTHloZkNpVQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F12968138423%2Fday-2-the-setup">http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-11-18-minecraft-review</a></p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/12968138423/day-2-the-setup.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;12968138423&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

Two hours later we were at Arlanda Airport and met up with the rest of the Mojang Team. We did some last minute shopping (power plug converters and toothpaste), had breakfast, then got on the flight to Heathrow Airport where we bought even more power plug converter thingies.</p><p>The second flight went all the way to Las Vegas. I have to say, British Airways has fairly decent airplane food, and the business class seats are amazing. I played some Skyrim on my MacBook Air, but I had turned down the settings so low the game actually became a bit annoying to play. In large indoors areas, the entire far area of the room would unload and just look like a skybox. So I gave up on that and played VVVVVV and Super Meat Boy instead. Luckily, I had brought an XBox 360 controller.</p><p>In Vegas, there were limos waiting to drive us to Mandalay Bay. Me and Elin got a really nice corner suite with a 180 degree panorama view of Las Vegas. We got a few free awesome rooms because of the convention, so I made sure to grab a good one for myself. Carl got something called a &ldquo;presidential suite&rdquo;, which everyone assumed would be a huge suite with lots of space. Turns out it was way smaller than the one me and Elin got, but we still had the first mojang gathering in Vegas in that room. There was pizza, fries, buffalo wings, dip sauces, and plenty of beverages. Deadmau5 was there and we talked a bit about the party on Saturday, which is going to be incredibly awesome.</p><p>Danny Baranowsky and Petri Purho stopped by, and Kyle Whatshisface from J!NX decided to tackle hug me while I was just barely able to stay awake. That was about my cue to head back to the hotel room and try to get some sleep. ;)</p><p>It&rsquo;s not 3:30 am, and the jetlag is playing with me. I&rsquo;ve never been more awake in my entire life.</p><p>Also, please vote for whatever game you think is the best one here: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.spike.com%2Fevents%2Fvideo-game-awards-2011-nominees%2Fvoting%2Fbest-pc-game&amp;t=NzI3OTZiOGEzNjgxMTkyYjcxZTkyOTY0NzNhNTFlMjBlYzRlNDk4NSxKMHJJTjFVZg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F12923077721%2Fday-1-the-arrival">http://www.spike.com/events/video-game-awards-2011-nominees/voting/best-pc-game</a> ;D</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/12923077721/day-1-the-arrival.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;12923077721&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

For me personally, it&rsquo;s going to be three full days of chaos and fans, which will probably leave me extremely tired. Then there&rsquo;s a big party with a huge celebrity act playing.

I will summarize and review them because I&rsquo;m waiting for a very slow script to finish and have nothing better to do! :D</p><p><strong>Inspiration!</strong><br />Ah! A new idea! I think I know how I could do an awesome thing, or there&rsquo;s a new aspect I want to try with an existing feature. Development speed is amazingly high and new ideas get thrown around. Some of it might not be perfect, and there&rsquo;s a significant risk of abandoning the project at this stage.</p><p>Fun: 5/5<br />Usefulness: 2/5<br />Fulfillment: 5/5<br />Productivity: 4/5</p><p><strong>Motivation!</strong><br />After the initial stage of inspiration, the project moves into the motivation driven phase. Features get tweaked and polished, and the overall design gets a final overhaul. Some boring things get pushed up until later, if possible.<br /><br />Fun: 3/5<br />Usefulness: 3/5<br />Fulfillment: 3/5<br />Productivity: 5/5</p><p><strong>Stress!<br /></strong>Suddenly I realize I need to finish the feature! Doubt sets in, and some deadline starts looming. Is it good enough? Is it even usable? Productivity drops suddenly, and the major motivator becomes just getting it done before the deadline. This usually leads to last minute work. Despite this, much of the work ends up being actually very good.</p><p>Fun: 1/5<br />Usefulness: 3/5<br />Fulfillment: 2/5<br />Productivity: 1/5</p><p><strong>Abandonment!</strong><br />Eventually, the project is considered &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;, or the deadline passes, and whatever is there will just have to serve as the final version. Sure, I could spend infinitely more time working on it, but new projects are either deemed more important, or some new inspiration sets in. The project is wrapped up and released.</p><p>Fun: 3/5<br />Usefulness: 5/5<br />Fulfillment: 4/5<br />Productivity: 3/5</p><p><br />Yes, I&rsquo;m talking about the ender dragon fight. ;)</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/12551870085/inspiration-motivation-stress-and-abandonment.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;12551870085&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

That means we&rsquo;ll release the full version of Minecraft (which will be called &ldquo;Minecraft&rdquo;, and have a version number of 1.0. The current version is &ldquo;Minecraft Beta&rdquo;). We&rsquo;ll keep working on Minecraft for a long time after the full release, but it&rsquo;s a huge milestone.</p><p>That milestone also means people might start reviewing the game. There have been a few reviews already, but I have a feeling most people are waiting for the full release.</p><p>This makes me nervous.</p><p>It does feel like the game has already proven itself. Lots of people play the game, and we receive a lot of friendly and positive emails from players.

While I am sceptical of the free to play trend, what I hate is the wording &ldquo;free to play&rdquo;.</p><p>The reason some people are moving to this area is that free to play showed up in the &ldquo;social gaming&rdquo; segment (facebook) and made a few people (zynga) very rich. It&rsquo;s been tried in other genres in other markets with decent success. By &ldquo;success&rdquo;, I mean &ldquo;it&rsquo;s profitable&rdquo;.
The reason anyone switches to &ldquo;free to play&rdquo; is to make more money. You get your players hooked on your game, and then you try to monetize them. The idea is to find a model where there basically is no cap on how much the player can spend, then try to encourage players to spend more and more money. Various psyhological traps like abusing the sense of sunk costs get exploited, and eventually you end up with a game that&rsquo;s designed more like a slot machine than half-life 2.</p><p>So instead of calling it &ldquo;free to play&rdquo;, we should call it &ldquo;as expensive as you want it to be&rdquo; or something.</p><p>I do not mind paying for games after the purchase. I like customizing my character, or getting a few extra levels (DX HR:Missing Link, woo!), or even paying a subscription cost for something with running costs.</p><p>But let&rsquo;s get one thing clear: people who think &ldquo;free to play&rdquo; is a great future are mostly game developers, not game players.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll go play some team fortress 2 now until dota 2 is released.

Back then, Minecraft had sold between half a million and one million copies, and now we&rsquo;re up to almost four million copies sold, we&rsquo;re expanding to two new platforms, and we&rsquo;re getting good progress done with our new game. In one month, we&rsquo;re going to Las Vegas to celebrate the full release of Minecraft with our fans. And we&rsquo;re getting sued by one of my favorite game developers.</p><p>I started working on Minecraft in the summer of 2009, starting with a top-down isometric mining game. The elevator pitch for the game was &ldquo;Dwarf Fortress meets Rollercoaster Tycoon meets Dungeon Keeper&rdquo;. It was an interesting game for sure that I&rsquo;d still like to see someone make, but then I played a game called Infiniminer and realized the first person perspective with blocky graphics worked really well and started prototyping it. The game went from being about controlling a team of characters to being a single player first person experience, with a focus on resource gathering and a somewhat coherent fantasy setting that would provide hopefully constant challenges and things to do.</p><p>After a little more than half a year of working on the game, people started talking about it and paying attention to it, so I was able to quit my day job and focus on it full time. I got flown out to Seattle to talk to Valve (and Bungie, as a bonus! :D). Valve&rsquo;s one of the places I&rsquo;d absolutely love to work at, the people are really nice and creative, and their new offices are amazingly nerd friendly. But I decided to instead focus on doing my own thing, called Jakob, and told him to quit his job.</p><p>Daniel joined, then Carl, then me and Jakob took a short field trip to Uppsala to meet with Junkboy, then Daniel suggested Jens, and all of the sudden we&rsquo;re 12 people in the office, with three more signed up. We&rsquo;re looking for a bigger office now. Fun!</p><p>We&rsquo;re officially one year old now, and things are more fun than ever. :D Thank you, everyone working at Mojang. You may miss morning meetings sometimes, and some of you have horrible taste in music, but I love you all! And, of course, none of this would&rsquo;ve been possible without the players and the fans, so thank you, person reading this!</p><p>Also, we&rsquo;ve won a big pile of awards. ;-D</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/11518566613/happy-birthday-us.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;11518566613&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

Gameplay consists of pushing buttons, sidestepping monsters and drinking potions.</p><p><strong>Eye of the Beholder </strong>(1991)<strong><br /></strong>A fairly straight forward first person dungeon crawler where going  deeper means getting closer to your goal. Gameplay consists of pushing  buttons, sidestepping monsters and drinking potions.</p><p><strong>Eye of the Beholder II&nbsp; - The Legend of Darkmoon</strong> (1992)<br />An evolved version of the original. This time you have to explore  different branches and return to the central hub. The boss fight is  epic, and the graphics are much better this time around.</p><p><strong>Dungeon Master II - The Legend of Skullkeep</strong> (1993)<br /> An evolved version of the original. This time you have to explore  different branches and return to the central hub. The boss fight is  epic, and the graphics are much better this time around.</p><p><strong>Eye of the Beholder III - Assault on Myth Drannor </strong>(1993)<br />More of the same, except this time it isn&rsquo;t fun. The charm is gone. Where is the charm?</p><p><strong>Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos </strong>(1993)<br />Oh, there it is!</p><p>And then the genre died. Sure, there were more dungeon crawlers, but they were all too complex. Dungeon Master II is one of the best games ever made. With every new game release, I hope to experience something like it again, but it&rsquo;s never the same.</p><p>But now, something wonderful is happening.

I call it the Mass Quantum Suicide Computer, or the MQSC for short.</p><p>You know Schr&ouml;dingers Cat? The one in the box that is both alive and dead until you observe it? There&rsquo;s a similar thought experiment in which you place yourself in the box and observe what happens. This is called &ldquo;Quantum Suicide&rdquo;. According to some interpretations, you will only ever observe yourself surviving, because in all other universes, your consciousness isn&rsquo;t around to observe yourself being dead. This leads to another concept called &ldquo;Quantum Immortality&rdquo;, which basically means that for any lethal situation, if there&rsquo;s any chance at all of you surviving it, you will only ever experience the universes in which you do. Of course, all your friends and family will still see you die in the vast majority of universes.</p><p>Unless you take them with you. Which I call &ldquo;Mass Quantum Suicide&rdquo;. Basically, you put the entire human race in the box, and you will all either die together or survive together.</p><p>So here&rsquo;s my computer:</p><p>1) Ask the computer any question.<br />2) The computer has a one in &lt;very, very, very large number&gt; chance of just saying &ldquo;try again&rdquo;. If it does, go back to 1.<br />3) The computer spits out a random reply.<br />4) Assume this reply is the correct answer, and leave the computer alone until it&rsquo;s verified that it actually was the correct answer.<br />5) The computer then spends as long time as it needs verifying that the reply is correct.<br />6) If the random reply turns out to be incorrect, destroy the universe. This can be done by, for example, setting of a true vacuum chain reaction.</p><p>In all universes where humans are still around, the computer will always either say &ldquo;try again&rdquo;, or spit out the correct answer immediately. Nobody will be around to observe the universes where it guesses wrong.</p><p>This computer works great for NP problems which are quick to verify that you have the correct answer for, as you don&rsquo;t have to leave the computer alone for very long in between asking it a question.</p><p>[EDIT:]</p><p>I thought this was an original idea, but it&rsquo;s been done before:<br /><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mathnews.uwaterloo.ca%2FIssues%2Fmn11103%2FQuantumBogoSort.php&amp;t=OWQxNmQ0OWU4YjdkN2EyZDlkM2I4YmM2M2UyOTkwMWRhZjRlYjQ5NCxER0FHRThGaA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F10526684412%2Fo1-np-solving-using-the-mqsc">http://www.mathnews.uwaterloo.ca/Issues/mn11103/QuantumBogoSort.php</a></p><p>Ah well. :D</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/10526684412/o1-np-solving-using-the-mqsc.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;10526684412&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

I don&rsquo;t have much news, but I can try to summarize the recent events in a colorful way:</p><p>Lawyers have been sending papers back and forth, threatening each other with deadlines and court dates. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we settle this in a mature way?&rdquo;, one party asks the other. &ldquo;Your MOTHER settles things in mature ways&rdquo;, the other party cleverly retorts, &ldquo;because of her age.&rdquo;<br />Last thing I heard, we were a couple of weeks past a &ldquo;super seriously, we will sue you for real this time&rdquo; deadline, and letters are still being sent back and forth.</p><p>In other news, here&rsquo;s a list of games I&rsquo;ve been playing recently, and my thoughts on them:</p><p><strong>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</strong><br />Charmingly retro, with a totally rubbish tranq sniper rifle. Unfair boss fights, fun level layout. The level up perks are kind of uninteresting, but it&rsquo;s still a lot of fun. Inventory management feels very Resident Evil 4, for good and for bad.<br />[edit: This makes it sound like I don&rsquo;t like the game! That is incorrect. I love it!!]</p><p><strong>Legends of Yore<br /></strong>I&rsquo;m just getting started playing this more seriously. It&rsquo;s a low res graphical roguelike made by one guy who I happen to know. Available on both phone types and on pc. I haven&rsquo;t gotten deep into it yet, but it seems to have everything I want.</p><p><strong>The Binding of Isaac<br /></strong>I got sneak peeks of this game, and it&rsquo;s shaping up nicely. It&rsquo;s a very lightweight action roguelike with plenty of dark humor and zelda references. Danny B&rsquo;s done a great job on the soundtrack again, even if it makes me a bit depressed.</p><p><strong>Diablo III Beta<br /></strong>No, just kidding, I didn&rsquo;t get in. :(</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/10211854536/update-on-the-scrolls-lawsuit-and-a-list-of.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;10211854536&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

There&rsquo;s programming, design, testing and just plain good old silliness. Here&rsquo;s a brief snapshot - a retelling of what I did this weekend!</p><p>I was putting in a few extra hours on Minecraft this weekend, refactoring code so biomes could directly decorate the terrain themselves rather than having the terrain check the biomes manually. That type of work is mostly just busy work, so it wasn&rsquo;t very interesting from a design perspective, but it was very rewarding form a programming perspective. Things were starting to fall into place, and biomes became much &ldquo;cleaner&rdquo;.</p><p>One of the results of that was the first draft of a swamp biome, which I posted a screenshot of. I got crazy amounts of great feedback on how to make it look swampier (it kinda looks like a happy grove at the moment), and almost all of them are entirely doable by only changing the SwampBiome.java class. Feels good!</p><p>While testing the biome code, I started running out of food in the game and started hunting animals. Cows would just stand there, looking at me as I mashed them over and over to get their precious loot, so I figured I&rsquo;d just make that mechanic a bit more fun. Four lines of code later, and animals now flee randomly after taking damage. Hunting animals suddenly became a lot more fun and morally questionable as pigs would storm off grunting and chicken (or whatever the heck they are) would jump into ravines. But the real fun came later on.</p><p>Someone tweeted me about a joking campaign to add 3d modeled snouts to the pigs in Minecraft, so I did. While doing so, I groaned at how the Cube class has an &ldquo;addBox&rdquo; method that actually means &ldquo;replaceBox&rdquo;, and how it really should be a &ldquo;Shape&rdquo; class with an &ldquo;addBox&rdquo; method that actually does what it says. Right now every box in a model has to be individually animated to match the part it&rsquo;s attached to, and there&rsquo;s no grouping or hierarcy. This is the reason why the horns on the cows are in the wrong location sometimes. I didn&rsquo;t fix the code for this, as I was running out of weekend, but I made a mental note to fix it asap.</p><p>Reddit loved my pic of a pig with a 3d snout. I got sooo much precious link karma.</p><p>Back to doing some further testing. I was exploring a forest biome, hit upon a river cutting through it, and walked over a small hill. On the other side, a wolf was chasing a sheep, but the sheep was running away. I didn&rsquo;t have this in mind when I wrote the code to make mobs flee, but it ended up giving me an unexpected experience of having some kind of echo system of competing behaviors in various animals, and it just felt.. nice. It made me realize we should explore more mob to mob interactions, and have more chaotic competing behavior.</p><p>I&rsquo;m doing a high priority secret project this week (a prototype for a future possible project), but I already have at least three things I want to work on as soon as I get back on Minecraft work next week.</p><p>The reason it&rsquo;s still fun is you. The community. Thank you. &lt;3</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/9896830082/you-know-whats-fun.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;9896830082&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

Lydia, who was organizing the flights to PAX and such, had emailed all of us, asking what kind of food we wanted on the flight. She listed all the options, and one of them was &ldquo;Bland&rdquo;.<br />That amused me immensely. It&rsquo;s like having an option that says &ldquo;over cooked&rdquo; or &ldquo;a bit on the salty side, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;. So naturally, after saying what me and Elin would prefer to eat, I added that Carl wants bland food. He&rsquo;s a bland food type of guy after all.<br />Lydia, who didn&rsquo;t pick up on the humor, went ahead and ordered that, and everybody forgot about it.</p><p>Lunch time on the flight to Seattle. It&rsquo;s about an 11 hour flight or so. The stewardess told Carl he was getting his &ldquo;special&rdquo; food, then got served a tiny portion of celery and some salad.</p><p>Thing is, Carl doesn&rsquo;t like bland food at all! Quite the contrary, he likes food with flavor, and decent portions of it to boot.</p><p>We all had a big laugh about it. So much fun. Then he forgot to change his order back to regular food in time for the flight back. ;D</p><p>So.. if you ever have dinner with Carl, remember that he likes BLAND food.</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/9587983628/then-theres-the-prank.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;9587983628&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

So I&rsquo;ll repeat what I said on here, because openess is awesome.</p><p>Steam is the best digital distribution platform I&rsquo;ve ever seen. I&rsquo;ve spent incredible amounts of money on it, and I own a crazy amount of games on it. It runs great, offers great services like that shift+tab stuff, and it remembers my credit card details so there&rsquo;s no barrier for me when I want to buy a game. The only downside I can think of is that offline mode is a bit flimsy, and that the game list is sometimes full off DLC releases for stuff I don&rsquo;t even own, and those are some tiny complaints!</p><p>But..</p><p>Being on Steam limits a lot of what we&rsquo;re allowed to do with the game, and how we&rsquo;re allowed to talk to our users. We (probably?) wouldn&rsquo;t be able to, say, sell capes or have a map market place on minecraft.net that works with steam customers in a way that keeps Valve happy. It would effectively split the Minecraft community into two parts, where only some of the players can access all of the weird content we want to add to the game.</p><p>We are talking to Valve about this, but I definitely understand their reasons for wanting to control their platform. There&rsquo;s a certain inherent incompatibility between what we want to do and what they want to do.</p><p>So there&rsquo;s no big argument, we just don&rsquo;t want to limit what we can do with Minecraft. Also, Steam is awesome. Much more awesome than certain other digital distribution platforms that we would NOT want to release Minecraft on.</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/9550850116/why-no-steam-notch.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;9550850116&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

I assume this nonsense is partly just their lawyers being lawyers, and a result of trademark law being the way it is.</p><p>About half a year ago, our lawyers recommended us to register &ldquo;Minecraft&rdquo; as a trademark, so we did. I had voted against it initially, but we did it anyway. Better safe than sorry, and all that. At the same time, we also applied for &ldquo;Scrolls&rdquo;, the new game we&rsquo;re working on. We knew of no similarly named games, and we had even googled it to make sure. I&rsquo;m not even sure if you CAN trademark individual words, like &ldquo;Scrolls&rdquo;, but we sent in the application anyway.</p><p>(Disclosure: We&rsquo;ve enforced the trademark for Minecraft once, when there was a minecraft clone on iOS, using our name. People were emailing me saying our iOS version was buggy and bad, so we asked them to change the name of their game, and they did.)</p><p>A while later, out of the blue, we got contacted by Bethesda&rsquo;s lawyers. They wanted to know more about the &ldquo;Scrolls&rdquo; trademark we were applying for, and claimed it conflicted with their existing trademark &ldquo;The Elder Scrolls&rdquo;. I agree that the word &ldquo;Scrolls&rdquo; is part of that trademark, but as a gamer, I have never ever considered that series of (very good) role playing games to be about scrolls in any way, nor was that ever the focal point of neither their marketing nor the public image.<br />The implication that you could own the right to all individual words within a trademark is also a bit scary. We looked things up and realized they didn&rsquo;t have much of a case, but we still took it seriously. Nothing about Scrolls is meant to in any way derive from or allude to their games. We suggested a compromise where we&rsquo;d agree to never put any words in front of &ldquo;Scrolls&rdquo;, and instead call sequels and other things something along the lines of &ldquo;Scrolls - The Banana Expansion&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m not sure if they ever got back to us with a reply to this.</p><p>Today, I got a 15 page letter from some Swedish lawyer firm, saying they demand us to stop using the name Scrolls, that they will sue us (and have already paid the fee to the Swedish court), and that they demand a pile of money up front before the legal process has even started.</p><p>I assume this is all some more or less automated response to us applying for the trademark. I sincerely hope Bethesda isn&rsquo;t pulling a Tim Langdell.</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/8519901309/bethesda-are-suing-us-heres-the-full-story.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;8519901309&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

That&rsquo;s cool and all, but.. To quote the video, the island in the video is one km^2. Let&rsquo;s assume a modest island height of just eight meters, and we end up with 0.008 km^3. At 64 atoms per cubic millimeter (four per millimeter), that is a total of 512 000 000 000 000 000 atoms. If each voxel is made up of one byte of data, that is a total of 512 petabytes of information, or about 170 000 three-terrabyte harddrives full of information. In reality, you will need way more than just one byte of data per voxel to do colors and lighting, and the island is probably way taller than just eight meters, so that estimate is very optimistic.</p><p>So obviously, it&rsquo;s not made up of that many unique voxels.</p><p>In the video, you can make up loads of repeated structured, all roughly the same size. Sparse voxel octrees work great for this, as you don&rsquo;t need to have unique data in each leaf node, but can reference the same data repeatedly (at fixed intervals) with great speed and memory efficiency. This explains how they can have that much data, but it also shows one of the biggest weaknesses of their engine.</p><p>Another weakness is that voxels are horrible for doing animation, because there is no current fast algorithms for deforming a voxel cloud based on a skeletal mesh, and if you do keyframe animation, you end up with a LOT of data. It&rsquo;s possible to rotate, scale and translate individual chunks of voxel data to do simple animation (imagine one chunk for the upper arm, one for the lower, one for the torso, and so on), but it&rsquo;s not going to look as nice as polygon based animated characters do.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a very pretty and very impressive piece of technology, but they&rsquo;re carefully avoiding to mention any of the drawbacks, and they&rsquo;re pretending like what they&rsquo;re doing is something new and impressive. In reality, it&rsquo;s been done several times before.</p><p>There&rsquo;s the very impressive looking Atomontage Engine: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGshc8GMTa1Y&amp;t=MmQxYTM4YjRjZTA5ODBiZmFjZjQ3N2M5NmZiYjVkYzljMTM0ZDJiOSxkb0J6dVlCbg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F8386977075%2Fits-a-scam">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gshc8GMTa1Y</a></p><p>Ken Silverman (the guy who wrote the Build engine, used in Duke Nukem 3D) has been working on a voxel engine called Voxlap, which is the basis for Voxelstein 3d: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DoB1eMC9Jdsw&amp;t=ZDdiNjhkMWRlOWZiZTAzNjI3M2U4N2Q1MmFjYjA0MGEyZGJiNTE0Myxkb0J6dVlCbg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F8386977075%2Fits-a-scam">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB1eMC9Jdsw</a></p><p>And there&rsquo;s more: <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DxUe4ofdz5oI&amp;t=MWYxY2Q0MWNlMThhZWQ0Y2I1ZDdiZGMzNDlmZDc5NTNiMGEyNzVhMyxkb0J6dVlCbg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F8386977075%2Fits-a-scam">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUe4ofdz5oI</a> <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DlEHIUC4LNFE&amp;t=M2IzMmQyZWQwZjM1MzljNDY5ZWRjMWRiNDY2ZThkZjVmNzRkZGRkMCxkb0J6dVlCbg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F8386977075%2Fits-a-scam">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEHIUC4LNFE</a> <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZl9CiGJiZuc&amp;t=ZmExZGQzMjkyMDg4NGMwZjcxZjExNDc4MTQzNmM4ZWE5MjlhMTY1Myxkb0J6dVlCbg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F8386977075%2Fits-a-scam">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl9CiGJiZuc</a></p><p>They&rsquo;re hyping this as something new and revolutionary because they want funding.

Ryan send me this interesting email about what different tradeoffs there are, and his experiences working with it:</p><blockquote><p>Very cool! Off the top of my head, here&rsquo;s a list of the main points:<br /><br />Implications behind changing height:<br /><br />-  Memory Implications: Due to the way chunks are architected internally,  the only relatively-easy way of increasing level height is to double it.  As a result, memory usage can spiral out of control very quickly when  increasing the number of bits available to the Y axis. A somewhat  short-sighted view would be to point out that this is wholly manageable  in SSP, but pragmatically, SMP is already a hornet&rsquo;s nest when it comes  to RAM usage, and the only way to increase the level height would be to  neatly double the memory footprint. Ouch!<br /><br />- CPU Implications: Chunk terrain generation occurs in pieces on the  X/Z plane, but expects the chunk to be fully populated along the Y  axis, from bedrock to sky. To be fair, much of this can be mitigated by  the fact that any terrain above a certain cutoff can be assumed to be  completely air, and any terrain below a certain cutoff can be assumed to  be completely stone, thus eliminating the need for temperature /  humidity / biome calculations far down in the level or high up in the  level. Nonetheless, it&rsquo;s still a cache-thrashing memory-fill operation.  Worse still, due to the fact that subterranean features are populated  per-chunk, to maintain a consistent distribution of ore you would need  to double the number of calls made to any given feature generator as  well for each doubling of the Y axis. While this is relatively cheap for  things like ore, it&rsquo;s eclipsed by the idea that cave generation would  need to occur along the entire Y axis, and being a recursive function,  this has the potential to get very costly very quickly.<br /><br />- Storage Implications: Anything stored in memory needs to be  serialized to disk and read back from disk. Given the fact that in SSP,  the number-one performance killer - even on my beastly computer - is  disk I/O, it would be a highly questionable idea to double the amount of  data that needs to be written out to disk. I&rsquo;m not completely sure if  chunks are gzipped before being written to disk, or if that only occurs  to chunks when transmitted over the network, but if they are, this  simply robs from Peter to pay Paul - it mitigates the disk I/O issue  while increasing the enormity of the CPU issue.<br /><br />- Network Implications: On SMP, Chunks need to be sent to many more  people many times more often than in SSP. It can be taken for granted,  from a client&rsquo;s perspective, just how much data needs to be shoved  around by the server, and although network packets are gzipped, it&rsquo;s  still an additional networking load, and still an additional CPU load as  well.<br /><br />Regarding changing the level height, it was &ldquo;easy&rdquo; to the extent  that it took me around 4 hours yesterday morning to do it, but only  because I&rsquo;ve been poking around the engine internals since January and  have been mentally keeping track of all of the assumptions in the code  on exactly that topic. From top to bottom:<br /><br />- Search through the codebase for &lt;&lt; 11 and &lt;&lt; 7, replace with &lt;&lt; 12 and &lt;&lt; 8 as necessary.<br />-  Search through the codebase for 128, this will hit the majority of  places that assume the map height as being 128, such as tile height  checks.<br /> - When changing the above locations, save yourself a recompile and make  sure to change any variables from bytes to shorts or ints if you&rsquo;re  increasing them past 128. Being a C++ engineer, I keep forgetting that  everything is implied as signed in Java.<br /> - Search through the codebase for 127, this will hit the remainder of places that assume the map height as being 128.<br />-  Search through the codebase for 64 and 63, this will hit the places  that assume sea level is at 64, as well as Iron&rsquo;s ore generator height  cutoff. Personally, I dialed sea level up to 96 from 64, rather than  fully double it up to 128, in order to have 32 additional tiles&rsquo; worth  of water height, but have an entire 96 additional tiles&rsquo; worth of land  height.<br /> - Fix up the level feature generators for Redstone, diamond, gold et al.<br />- Visually grep through all of the level feature generator classes, doubling the RNG baseline and spread for each one.<br />- Change a few instances of 32768 to 65536 to accommodate 16*256*16 rather than 16*128*16.<br /> - I&rsquo;m not sure how much of this is a result of JAD and how much of it is  actual code, but there are a few instances of &ldquo;char whatever = &rsquo;\200&rsquo;;&rdquo;  in the MCP codebase, change it to a short or int containing 256 instead  of 128.<br /><br />I have to say that the game was *remarkably* performant with the Y  height pushed up to 256. I imagine 512 might not be too bad on my beast  of a machine, either, though 1024 would be pushing it. That said, one of  my short-term &ldquo;just for fun&rdquo; goals is to see if I can&rsquo;t get the Nether  to populate from 0-127, the main world from 128-255, your Sky dimension  from 256-383, and then that one group of modders&rsquo; new dimension, the  Aether, from 384-511. That would be epic.<br /><br />Additionally, there&rsquo;s a mod that some guy made that re-works chunks  to be 16x16x16 (it appears), but I&rsquo;m rather nonplused by it. The bug  list is as long as my arm, and it doesn&rsquo;t actually rescale any of the  terrain-generation features, so you don&rsquo;t get neat things like this: <a target="_blank" href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fmoogle-tech.com%2Fbce%2Fgorge.png&amp;t=NDk0ZDNmZGMwMzRlODFmMWM5M2MxMzhlZDkyODY4YmRkOTFjYTJkNCxYUzJOMUlkUA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F7799649091%2Fsharing-an-interesting-email">http://moogle-tech.com/bce/gorge.png</a><br /><br />As a result, I&rsquo;m in the process of just trying to re-do what he did  on my own. I&rsquo;m filling all chunks above Y=256 entirely with air, filling  all chunks below 0 with stone, manually invoking the cave generator,  and theoretically things should just work. In principle, theory is a  flimsy thing to go on, and to that end I&rsquo;ve been chasing down bugs for  the past 4-5 hours. At present I&rsquo;m able to get in-game, but the chunks  are horribly mis-arranged, so I suspect I&rsquo;ve missed an important hashing  function somewhere, since that would also explain why it&rsquo;s spitting out  reams of &ldquo;Wrong location!&rdquo; exceptions that it&rsquo;s spitting out whenever  it tries to spawn animals - the level provider is providing the wrong  chunk.</p><p>&lt;snip&gt;<br /><br />Cheers,<br />- R</p></blockquote>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/7799649091/sharing-an-interesting-email.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;7799649091&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">
