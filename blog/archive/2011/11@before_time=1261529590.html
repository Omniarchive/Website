He is also an independent game developer, creating games such as Tumbledrop ( <a>http://www.tumbledrop.com</a> ).</p><p>When I sent out the request for artists, I got about 30 applications over just a few days. Some of those were really impressive artists with loads of industry experience, others were very talented pixel artists. But the one applicant I thought would fit best was Dock.<br />His sense of style and strong characters will combine well with the creative and playful feel of the game, and I feel it will add a lot of much needed personality to the game.</p><p>To start it off, he&rsquo;s designing a new logo for the game. This is the current version:</p><p><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kv2hdodmha1qzb7ox.png" class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image"/></p><p>The logo says very much about the style and feel of whatever it is a logo for, and I think this is very friendly and playful, with a certain nice retro touch to it. It also incorporates the blockiness of the game with the clouds without giving it too much focus.</p><p>He&rsquo;s also been working hard on making player models. We just recently got the MD3 code to work relatively well (normal data is missing when there are animations! odd!). Here&rsquo;s a sketch of the direction we are going in:</p><p><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kv2hgo4Nel1qzb7ox.jpg" class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image"/></p><p>It isn&rsquo;t as square and blocky as the old models, and that kinda scared me at first. But when the more I thought about it, the more I realized that this was the way to go. Given enough square edges, the models will fit in fine, and these are much more customizable and have much more personality.</p><p>(If you&rsquo;re in love with your current character skin, don&rsquo;t worry; everyone who buys the game while it&rsquo;s still in alpha will be able to use the old classic model and skin.)</p><p>I&rsquo;m very excited to have you help out with the game, Dock!</p><p>We&rsquo;d love feedback on this, so either reply to this blog entry, or email me at markus@mojang.com. So..

I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what was going wrong at first, so I just restarted it. That seemed to fix it, so I left it alone.</p><p>Then I got reports that people were unable to log in, and I got curious. In an attempt to see what was going wrong, I cleaned out the backups directory (after having saved them), and I noticed they were being written very fast, like once per second.</p><p>A while back, I made the server save a backup of the full user database whenever the database changes. I also made it store the last-logged intime so I can clear out unused accounts (ie registered and last-logged in same date) if I ever need to in the future. When people log in, that flag gets changed.<br />Saving the database is blocking and takes just over one second. If a lot of people try to log in, the server will get very busy.</p><p>So now it&rsquo;ll only update the backups &ldquo;every once in a while&rdquo; on logins, but always and immediately on purchases.</p><p>That seemed to solve the problem. =)</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/293901132/a-slight-server-snag-has-been-fixed-now.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;293901132&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

The closer you are to the ground, the darker they are, and they don&rsquo;t hover out over the edges of tiles.<br />It does cost some cpu power to do the calculations, so it&rsquo;ll probably be an option, and it will only be visible for nearby players, but it really adds a lot of depth to the scene.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot with an unrelated MD3 model running:</p><p><img src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kuwf2rmNx51qzb7ox.png" class="toggle_inline_image inline_image constrained_image"/></p><p><i>Conclusion: This was a trumph!<br /></i></p><p><b>Light sources and darker caves</b></p><p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure this is going to work, but it&rsquo;s terribly complicated. I&rsquo;ve implemented a per-block light value and is working on having tiles be able to emit light. At the very most basic level, I CAN make single tiles lit up if they&rsquo;re set at lit, much like how lava works now. But it&rsquo;s also fairly trivial to propagate lighting information.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve experimented some with this before. If a tile gets set at &ldquo;lit at level 10&rdquo;, all tiles next to it who are lit to less than 9 gets set to 9, which in turn causes them to set all surrounding tiles to 8 and so on. Note that the effect only spreads if it actually CHANGES a value. Light won&rsquo;t spread through light blocking blocks (that&rsquo;s most of them), but it will curve around corners. While that isn&rsquo;t realistic, I think it&rsquo;s an acceptable trade-off between speed and niceness. It also somewhat fakes ambient lighting reflected off the sides.</p><p>Lava would cast light, so would sunlight, and torches, and.. well.. we&rsquo;ll see what else. This makes deep caves really dark, but there&rsquo;s still a problem with the fog being white. You end up seeing everything anyway since the cave goes black but the further away something is, the whiter it is. Finding out what color the fog should be on a per tile basis is VERY complicated and can&rsquo;t be done, unfortunately.</p><p><i>Conclusion: I&rsquo;m making a note here.</i></p><p><b>Wall-hack protection</b></p><p>Well, this is just easy when you know how. A player needs two blocks to be able to move. Thankfully, this includes the half block tiles. You can&rsquo;t squeeze into the area of 1.5 blocks there, but there ALWAYS has to be two blocks vertically next to each other for you to be able to move there.</p><p>For the player to be able to move from one of these &ldquo;two block hole&rdquo; to another, the other one has to be right next to the first one, either to the north, west, east, south, up or down.</p><p>Finding if a player is currently inside a &ldquo;two block hole&rdquo; is trivial. Finding if a realistically short path of &ldquo;two block holes&rdquo; exists from their last position to the new position is also trivial.<br />If either of those two ever are false (ie he&rsquo;s inside a block, or he traveled through a block), just teleport him back to his last known safe position.<br />(If someone has placed a block in his last known safe position.. well.. I don&rsquo;t really know. :D)</p><p>In practice, because of latency issues, this means that you will get teleported back sometimes if you run past someone who managed to place a tile in front of you. But it&rsquo;s better than wall hacking.</p><p><i>Conclusion: Huge success!</i></p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/290217078/ive-been-feeling-experimental-lately-here-are-my.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;290217078&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

Garcia plays a prison guard with secret acting ambitions. He  decides to house a criminal without telling him or the rest of the family  that he is his father. I kept laughing along with the rest of the audience  during this film which made it a good movie experience. Although the  care-for-your-loved-ones-and-don&rsquo;t-lie-too-much point is nothing new,  this film manages to tell it well.</p><p>Worst part: Garcia does a Marlon  Brandon impersonation.</p><p>Best part: The youngest son&rsquo;s  never ending blunt honesty at the dinner table.</p><p>4/5</p><p><b>Together</b> <a target="_blank" href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt1324056%2F&amp;t=YzdkNWE2OTRjOTdiZjQ1NDZiNmRkODhkZDkyMjQ3NGNhNDAyMDE5NixCamFDdUFWOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F264019619%2Ffilm-festival-reviews-part-11">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1324056/</a></p><p>This is a film about how a  family can be torn apart by loss. It also shows very well an egocentric  childish mind at work. I was moved by some scenes but the film has now  faded away and proves not to be that memorable. The every day life is  very good portrayed and the psychology is interesting. It&rsquo;s refreshing  to see a film where people are put to harm but where noone is really  evil. Most people do mean well.</p><p>Worst part: When the father  fails to make pizza dough - it&rsquo;s exaggerated.</p><p>Best part: The sudden turn  in the beginning of the movie.

He repeatedly repents for his sins, but keeps ruling with an iron fist because he either feels he has to or because he&rsquo;s just plain insane. In the start of his movie, he appoints his old friend (who is now a monk) as the new <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMetropolitan_bishop&amp;t=YWQ1MTVhNDdiZDZlNDY5NTA4MGM1MmVhMzYwMWY5ODdjOWI3MmJhOSxTa05YeTJWRQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F259393291%2Ffilm-festival-reviews-part-10">Metropolitan</a> after the old one had left to live at a monastery.<br />The two friends spend pretty much the rest of the movie trying to convince each other either to forgive and be kind or that violence and strictness is needed to rule a nation. That&rsquo;s two hours of Russian men kissing each others bearded cheeks and talking about god&rsquo;s will.<br />Mixed in with these are some scenes from a battle in Poland, a few religious near-miracles, and a fascinating young orphan child.<br />When I saw this movie, a guy in the audience kept laughing at things that really weren&rsquo;t supposed to be funny. When the Metropolitan told the Tsar that he was the guily one and that he was the one that should be judged, the Tsar replied &ldquo;I forgive you. Judge yourself&rdquo;, and the guy laughed. Sure, what the Tsar said was kinda witty and quick and a mean way of passively agressively punishing someone, but when you laugh at someone that powerful and deranged, you really undermine the entire feel of the movie for everyone else in the room.</p><p>Best part: When the Tsar gets dressed after having prayed, at the start of the movie.<br />Worst part: The opening scene of the fourth act felt very out of place.<br />Score: 4/5</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/259393291/film-festival-reviews-part-10.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;259393291&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

Part 9.</div><p><b>Dogtooth</b></p><p>Two parents keep their children away from society, tricking them into believing that the world outside is dangerous and that the only safe way to leave is by car. The father takes the car to work every day, and brings back food and other things they need. The disinformation they feed the children is a great source of comedy, and that&rsquo;s good since the rest of the movie is pretty intense and bleak. All sides of humanity (even if repressed and disturbing) are shown in fairly graphic detail.<br />I found it both shocking and refreshing to see both violence and sexuality shown on screen. Usually only violence gets shown, but sexuality gets hidden and only hinted at to the level where we as an audience find even images of bare breasts to be risque.<br />Either this is a result of American values dominating cinema because of the success of Hollywood, or it&rsquo;s simply a result of most people not being violent so it&rsquo;s easier to escape into fantasies of violence that one would never act upon than to escape into sexual themes which are much truer to what one really is like.<br />Who knows?<br />Just don&rsquo;t bring your mother to this movie.<br />The actual plot itself feels secondary. The movie tries to make a comment on something I don&rsquo;t quite understand (even despite hearing the director comment on it after the movie in a face to face), and it ends up feeling a bit over the top and weird. It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re expected NOT to get the movie. (Which, btw, is why I can&rsquo;t stand David Lynch) I much prefer it when there&rsquo;s something to get, but it&rsquo;s well hidden.</p><p>Best part: The Elder!

Part 8.</div><p><i>I&rsquo;m really enjoying this year&rsquo;s festival! Nine more movies to go, of which six are this weekend.</i></p><p><b>Fantastic Mr. Fox</b></p><p>Being based on the book by Roald Dahl, this movie has a very fantastic feel to it. Everything is quick and silly and over the top. Sometimes the pacing reminds a bit of a Pixar movie with things happening in quick succession.<br />The movie is beatifully animated with stop motion, even though it doesn&rsquo;t look as clean as other stop motion movies like Nightmare Before Christmas. There&rsquo;s an almost experimental feel to the movie, with stiff walk animations and fur randomly changing place between frames, but it only helps to bring out the fun. Children stories SHOULD be experimental.<br />George Clooney plays Mr. Fox, but feels a bit out of place. There&rsquo;s a slight disconnect between the voice we hear and the character we see on the screen. The rest of the cast are spot on. Bill Murray plays the Badger perfectly. This is the third movie I&rsquo;ve seen with Bill Murray in in just three weeks. I thought he was taking a break from acting?</p><p>Best part: The digging animation cracked me up every time I saw it.<br />Worst part: Mr. Fox&rsquo;s trademark, a whiste and some clicking sound, was just annoying.<br />Score: 4/5</p><p><b>Extract</b></p><p>After having run a flavor extract factory and business for many years, the owner gets a chance to sell his company and retire. Then a bunch of very entertaining, but loosely related stuff happens and everyone laughs.<br />Mike Judge, who made this movie, isn&rsquo;t exactly known for making coherent movies. Beavis and Butthead Do America was good but random, Office Space was <i>great</i> but random, and Idiocracy was just plain bad. Extract has some separate threads going that coincide with each others at points, but it manages to feel more like Office Space than Idiocracy.<br />Ben Affleck, who I&rsquo;ve never seen do anything even close to good acting, plays the best and funniest role in the movie. I&rsquo;m not sure if this means that the rest are bad, or that Ben finally felt comfortable with a role.<br />And, great surprise: In this movie, David Koechner plays an annoying, kind of dumb, shouty guy. It&rsquo;s still funny, though.</p><p>Best part: The last gag in the movie was by far the best. Subtle and crude at the same time. Perfect.<br />Worst part: One of the characters suddenly acts waaay out of character for no explained reason, other than pure plot convenience.<br />Score: 4/5</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/256177192/film-festival-reviews-part-8.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;256177192&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

Part 7. </div><p><b>Humpday</b></p><p>Two close friends meet again after several years apart. One is married and traditional, the other is free and rebellious. They go to a part with some very open minded and artistic people and start discussing shooting a porn movie for an upcoming porn/art festival called Humpfest. They all agree (while drunk) that a porno movie where two straight guys have sex would be very groundbreaking and artistic, so they decide to do so on Saturday.<br />During the next days, they struggle with their promise, struggle with their own self-image of who they think they are, and with telling Married Guy&rsquo;s wife about their plans. It&rsquo;s all very hilarious, very honest, and very realistic. I ended up caring a lot about the characters, thanks to very competent and subtle acting. A lot got said in just small changes of expression.<br />Last year, I saw <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBaghead&amp;t=MjA0NDNjOGFmOWYyMzY4NTEzMWMwN2U4NjUxNjllYzgwNTZiMDEwMyxYUXlnQzZ4eQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F254130223%2Ffilm-festival-reviews-part-7">Baghead</a> at the Film Festival, and I really loved it. This movie was quite similar in style to that movie, and it turns out that the director of Baghead stars in Humpday, so I assume it&rsquo;s a similar group of people who made this movie, seeing as how both are small independent films.</p><p>I&rsquo;m telling you, keep an eye out for these people.</p><p>Best part: Soo much charisma and fine subtle acting makes you really feel like you&rsquo;re a part of what&rsquo;s happening.<br />Worst part: The scene where his wife found out, while hilarously funny, felt every so slightly fake.<br />Score: 5/5</p><p><b>World&rsquo;s Greatest Dad</b></p><p>Robin Williams plays a teacher who spends his free time raising his son and writing novels. His great dream is to get published, but he&rsquo;s never gotten anything published so far despite having written several novels.<br />His son goes to the school he teaches at, and is egoistic, rude and has a twisted sexuality. For example, early on in the movie, Robin&rsquo;s character catches him choking himself with a belt while masturbating.<br />The acting was average, the plot was unlikely, and Robin kept injecting his small cute little jokes (&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come over and put my penis in your vagina. That&rsquo;s a single entendre!&rdquo;), making it hard to focus on the character he was supposed to play.

Still, this is the best movie of the festival so far.</p><p>Bart&rsquo;s been killed while serving military duty, and the movie starts out with his funeral. There&rsquo;s some fast and funny dialogue to set the tone of the movie, which is intelligent and funny. Then Bart wakes up, and he doesn&rsquo;t feel well. He crawls out from his grave and goes to see his friend, who obviously is shocked to see him. In what is probably the best scene in the movie, Bart tries to convince his friend that he really is there, and that he really is dead, and that he won&rsquo;t hurt him.<br />Accepting just single unbelievable event (him being undead), the rest of the movie feels very realistic. That initial meeting is probably very similar to how people would react in real life, and Barts reaction to being undead feels very believable. It&rsquo;s very refreshing to see a &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; zombie movie like this, even if it&rsquo;s primarily a (quite funny) comedy.<br />There are a few scenes which i feel step too far away from the realism for the sake of what I assume is satire, but overall it&rsquo;s more or less perfect. And the gore is beautiful.</p><p>Best part: I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this. Wow.<br />Worst part: A drawn out and unrealistic sequence of several innocent people dying. Fortunately, the rest of the movie is much more accessible.<br />Score: 5/5</p><p><b>White Lightning</b></p><p>I think for artistic reasons, this movie has the saturation turned way down, almost to the point of being black and white, is shot in 4:3 ratio, and has very grainy photography. The entire movie is narrated by the main character, who we get to follow from his troubled childhood up to the current day as he tries to explain why he&rsquo;s recently murdered several people. The tone of the movie is interesting, as most of the world in the movie feels relatively good and wholesome while the main character repeatedly seeks out the worst, abusing drugs and being violent.<br />He claims there&rsquo;s an evil in his blood, and that he tries to stop it. But it mostly seems like he&rsquo;s just trying to sabotage for himself as much as he can.<br />Carrie Fisher plays a part in this movie, which was a bit surprising.</p><p>Best part: The actor who played the narrator as a child was very good.<br />Worst part: A bit inaccessible due to being too &ldquo;artsy&rdquo;, and too long winded.<br />Score: 2/5</p><p>(Initially, I thought it was a 1/5 when I first saw it.

It&rsquo;s very well made, and drawn out, and rewarding.

Nihilism, maybe?<br />A man in a series of suits drinks espresso, trades matchboxes, does&rsquo;t speak spanish, and is not an american gangster.<br />Jim Jarmusch, the director, obviously tries really hard to make a movie that means something. But in the end, it doesn&rsquo;t mean anything. It&rsquo;s just flat, and boring, and repetetive. Then again, I&rsquo;ve got a feeling that&rsquo;s the point.<br />Once I gave up and just accepted the slow pace, the movie really started to blossom. The movie makes no sense at all to me on an intellectual level, but it feels like it should. Like there&rsquo;s something there. Perhaps I&rsquo;m just overthinking it? I like this feeling, and will see more of Mr. Jarmusch&rsquo;s movies.</p><p>Best part: The audience was dead silent during the entire movie.<br />Worst part: They were probably sleeping..

Turns out I didn&rsquo;t have to, as this movie has almost nothing to do with the previous one. It takes place several hundred years before the events in the first movie, is about totally different people, and has a much darker tone.<br />A young (noble?) child witnesses his parents get murdered, and sets out to take revenge on the murderers. There&rsquo;s lot of revenge and swords and bloods and malice, but the fighting scenes are almost as well choreographed and enjoyable as in the first movie.<br />As a Scandinavian viewer, I found many of the non-combat scenes strangely paced and didn&rsquo;t understand much of the imagery or the cultural references.</p><p>Best part: A big bad mean guy whips his hair around his neck for no reason other than it looks cool.

The movie starts out as somewhat of a comedy as we follow a strangely amnesiac boy trying to get revenge on some big-shots that almost ran him over. Then this entire plot line is more or less dropped entirely, and completely different things happen where a girl gets murdered. Then more plot lines get dropped and new ones introduced.

This is just a very minor tweak right now, but it will allow the game to potentially load models from disk in the future, if needed.<br />* Adding hooks for scripting in the server<br />* New level file format. This one is BAAADLY needed as the current one just uses java serialization, which is a great way of painting yourself into a corner. I will make every effort to keep compatibility with old level files, but it will only load old level terrain data. All monsters and item resources on the map will be reset when loading an old map.</p><p>Left to do in the code split are the mobs and resources, and the server project.</p><p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate that this means no visible changes for a while, but I will get at least an update for survival mode based on the old code out this week so you can play around with the sheep.</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/232767907/code-split-going-good-so-far.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;232767907&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">

The plan is to split the code up into several separate projects with hierarchial dependencies. The core basic one will just be a basic data container and level loading/saving.</p><p>Minecraft.World - Just the data, and loading/saving that data.<br />Minecraft.Client - Rendering, interpolation, user input, server communication<br />Minecraft.Server - Hosting a headless game and sending updates to that world over network.</p><p>I&rsquo;m trying to work out if I should put game logic in World or in a separate project. If I put it in a separate project, it&rsquo;ll be easy to write new game logic, but I have to do a lot of annoying tile type bindings when I could just stick it the initial definition in World.. hmm.</p>            </div></div><div class="post_glass post_micro_glass_w_controls post_micro_glass" title=""><a target="_blank" class="hover" title="" href="../../post/231757003/what-ive-been-doing-for-the-last-couple-of-days.html"  data-peepr="{&quot;tumblelog&quot;:&quot;notch&quot;,&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;231757003&quot;}" ><div class="hover_inner"><span class="post_date">
