                        <p>Back before anyone knew who I was, I used to wanted to make huge games. Games where you can
                            do anything, and everything you see in the game is there for a reason in the game. No fake
                            doors that don&rsquo;t lead anywhere, no trees you can&rsquo;t cut down, and no made up
                            story being told to the player to motivate them. Instead, the player would make their own
                            story, and interact with the game world, decide for themselves what they want to do.</p>
                        <p>I&rsquo;ve worked on two games like this. The first one I made with Rolf, and it was called
                            <a

                                Online</a>, and it&rsquo;s slow and grindy, but amazing. A few years later, I made <a
                                href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fminecraft.net%2F&amp;t=ZGFiOTQ0MDRhNTNmY2NiOTcyNzNmNjQzZmQ2NGEwODgwOTI0ZTJjZSx5Z0dUTktycA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F58707926941%2Fso-thats-what-im-going-to-do">Minecraft</a>&nbsp;just
                            as indie games were becoming a big thing, and it absolutely exploded. Because I enjoy
                            talking to the players and community, and possibly because I will gladly share my opinions
                            on things, I became recognized and got loads of fans. And then my tweets started becoming
                            gaming news.
                        </p>
                        <p>About a year ago, I started working on a third &ldquo;omg you can do anything&rdquo; game,
                            called <a
                                href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2F0x10c.com%2F&amp;t=ZjY1MjA0MTA3NGI0MWZhZDA0OWE4YTNhMTkyYWM0Mjk3ZjAxZDgwZCx5Z0dUTktycA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F58707926941%2Fso-thats-what-im-going-to-do">0x10c</a>.
                            It was supposed to be a space game about actually being in character in space rather than
                            playing as a space ship like you do in most space games. You&rsquo;d try to keep your ship
                            live while shooting aliens with laser guns, putting out fires and programming your own
                            virtual computer in the ship. It was quite ambitious, but I was fairly sure I could pull it
                            off. And besides, if I failed, <em>so what</em>? A lot of my prototypes fail way before they
                            get anywhere at all.</p>
                        <p>What I hadn&rsquo;t considered was that a lot more people cared about my games now. People
                            got incredibly excited, and the pressure of suddenly having people care if the game got made
                            or not started zapping the fun out of the project. I spent a lot of time thinking about if I
                            even wanted to make games any more. I guess I could just stop talking about what I do, but
                            that doesn&rsquo;t really come all that natural to me. Over time I kinda just stopped
                            working on it, and then eventually decided to mentally file it as &ldquo;on ice&rdquo; and
                            try doing some smaller things. Turns out, what I love doing is making games. Not hyping
                            games or trying to sell a lot of copies. I just want to experiment and develop and think and
                            tinker and tweak.</p>
                        <p>Recently, I was streaming some Team Fortress 2, and got asked about the progress on 0x10c. I
                            said I wasn&rsquo;t working on it, and it became news. I understand why, and it really
                            shouldn&rsquo;t surprise me, but I really <em>really</em> don&rsquo;t want to turn into
                            another under delivering visionary game designer. The gaming world has enough of those.</p>

                                to work together to make their own version of their game</a>, called Project Trillek. I
                            find this absolutely amazing. I want to play this game so much, but I am not the right
                            person to make it. Not any more. I&rsquo;m convinced a new team with less public interest
                            can make a vastly superior game than what I would make.</p>

                        <div class="post_title">I love you, dad</div>
                        <p>One of my fondest childhood memories is me sitting on a sled, being dragged along a thinly
                            snow covered road by my dad. I was looking up at him and reflecting on the fact that he is
                            also an individual person, just as I am. He has his own thoughts, his own wants, and his own
                            memories. He&rsquo;d had an entire life to live before I even existed.</p>
                        <p>Before he had me and my sister, he struggled with substance abuse and addiction, but managed
                            to get over it with the help of religion and will power. I never knew anything about this,
                            and never suspected anything until he had a relapse when I was a young teenager. This led to
                            my parents breaking up and me not talking to him for a couple of years. When I eventually
                            got over it and forgave him, we developed a very close and loving relationship.</p>
                        <p>He was around when Rolf and I made Wurm Online, and would play it a lot. He ran his own
                            homestead and built some alliances, before finally getting tired of the game and moving on
                            to Half Life 1 and 2. He&rsquo;d sometimes call me and ask how to get past a certain point,
                            and I would try to give him subtle hints. He had moved pretty far away in the country, both
                            to avoid bad influences in Stockholm, and to isolate himself. I&rsquo;d go visit sometimes.
                        </p>
                        <p>Once during a spring visit, we went out with his car to a beautiful lake area and had some
                            coffee and sandwiches, when his dog suddenly ran out on the very thin ice. We freaked out a
                            bit and yelled at the dog to come back when the ice suddenly gave out and the dog fell in.
                            It struggled to get up for a while before giving up and just hanging on to the ice, at which
                            point my dad lays down on the ice and starts sliding out towards the dog. I&rsquo;m running
                            around, looking for a long stick or something (I wasn&rsquo;t entirely sure what I would do
                            with it, I just vaguely remembered something about long sticks being useful for ice
                            accidents). I find one, turn around, see my dad being really close to the dog when all of
                            the sudden a big chunk of ice around him breaks loose, tips over, and my dad falls in. I
                            freak out. Then he stands up, the water only reaching about hip height.</p>
                        <p>The speed at which things had escalated from beautiful spring day to almost losing my dad was
                            incredibly scary, and then suddenly realizing there never was any real danger sent me into a
                            state of shock. I love my dad.</p>
                        <p>When I said I wanted to quit my day job and work on my own games, he was the only person who
                            told me they supported my decision. When I made Minecraft, he was incredibly proud. He saw
                            me win awards, and he saw the fans embrace the games, and he saw me start my own company. I
                            said I wanted to fly him to Minecon, and he was reluctant because he wasn&rsquo;t very
                            comfortable with crowds of people, but he still went. He was obviously very proud of me the
                            entire time, but acted a bit strange. We were afraid he had started abusing again.</p>
                        <p>He had wanted to move back to Sweden to be able to spend more time with us, so I helped him
                            with the rent on a small house just outside of Stockholm, but at the last minute, he backed
                            out. He had begun drinking alcohol again, and his anti-depressant drugs was making him act a
                            bit strange at times.</p>
                        <p>The speed at which things escalated from him wanting to move back home to him shooting
                            himself in the head was incredibly scary. His last thoughts, wants and memories was one year
                            ago. I now have an entire life to live without him existing.</p>

                        <p>I have never once said I don&rsquo;t like closed platforms. I have quite a few of them laying
                            around my house, and I love most of them. My Nintendo 3DS brings me headaches and remakes of
                            good games, my PSP Go is pretty much the only one sold in the entire world, and my cable
                            modem from Cisco brings me amazing internet access almost 98% of the time.</p>
                        <p>But my favorite device out of all of them is my PC. It&rsquo;s an open platform, designed to
                            be open, and to allow different hardware and software to all work together kinda-sorta crash
                            free, and it&rsquo;s amazing. I can install whatever OS I want on it, or even write my own
                            if I happened to be a mad genius (I wish). I care a lot about my PC, and I want it to stay
                            open, and will not participate in anything that would make it more closed.</p>
                        <p>For every user Microsoft convinces to use the Modern UI, they have one more user they get to
                            choose what programs they can see. They get to certify programs and control the experience.
                            This is great for them (and possibly arguable makes for a smoother end user experience as
                            well, but that&rsquo;s debatable if it&rsquo;s good), but it places faaaaar too much power
                            in the hands of a single entity.</p>
                        <p>This is my complaint.</p>
                        <p>Now, on to personal things.</p>
                        <p>You&rsquo;ve never ever been cruel to animals as far as I know, and I find that very charming
                            and manly. It&rsquo;s one of the things I like most about you, in fact, and it would be a
                            huge shame if you ever did something cruel to animals, but I know you won&rsquo;t. So thank
                            you for not being a goat murderer! It wouldn&rsquo;t fit you at all!</p>
                        <p>Thanks for the personal attack,<br />Markus</p>

                        is. This post is about what I thought about back when I was making it]
                        <p>If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that the default Minecraft character is referred to as
                            &ldquo;Minecraft Guy&rdquo; and that I once jokingly answered &ldquo;Steve?&rdquo; when
                            asked what his* name was, Minecraft would be a game where gender isn&rsquo;t a gameplay
                            element.</p>
                        <p>The human model is intended to represent a Human Being. Not a male Human Being or a female
                            Human Being, but simply a Human Being. The blocky shape gives it a bit of a traditional
                            masculine look, but adding a separate female mesh would just make it worse by having one
                            specific model for female Human Beings and male ones. That would force players to make a
                            decisions about gender in a game where gender doesn&rsquo;t even exist.</p>
                        <p>All the other mobs in the game are genderless and usually exhibit the most prominent traits
                            of both genders. Cows have horns and udders (even if I&rsquo;ve later learned that there are
                            some cows where the females do have horns), and the chicken/duck/whatevers have heads that
                            look like roosters, but still lay eggs. For breeding, any animal can breed with any other
                            animal of the same species.</p>
                        <p>Obviously, I&rsquo;m not saying this is a good way to deal with gender in all games, as the
                            better your graphics are, and because of how quickly the human mind tries to identify the
                            gender of other humans, you are going to have to make a decision as a developer about
                            gender, but I felt we could get away with it in Minecraft.</p>
                        <p>There&rsquo;s no point to this post. I just wanted to clarify, so there&rsquo;s an official
                            word on it.</p>
                        <p>Also, as a fun side fact, it means every character and animal in Minecraft is homosexual
                            because there&rsquo;s only one gender to choose from. Take THAT, homophobes!</p>
                        <p><em><br /></em></p>
                        <p><em>* I do regret using masculine terms to talk about the default character. These days I try
                                to use the up-and-coming use of &ldquo;they&rdquo; as a genderless pronoun.</em></p>

                            <p>3. Patents are there to stop people stealing a technology you invented and letting you
                                have a fair shot at making a living from it. If Uniloc wants to test this in court it is
                                there&nbsp;prerogative, the same way that Mojang contested the use of the copyright term
                                &ldquo;Scrolls&rdquo; and took people to court.<br /><br /><a

                        <p>He&rsquo;s confusing four very different things here. First of all, he calls it
                            &ldquo;<em>stealing</em>&rdquo;, but nothing is lost from the victim in the case of using
                            the same idea. In fact, you can break this law without even knowing that someone else
                            thought of the idea first. This is one of the biggest problems with patents; there is no
                            good safe way to find out if any idea you come up with is patented or not. Most other crimes
                            require intent, patent infringement does not.</p>
                        <p>Then he goes on to compare <em>patent</em> infringement to <em>copyright</em> infringement,
                            by bringing up when Bethesda sued US for <em>trademark</em> infringement, while implying
                            that it was us suing them.</p>
                        <p>So in a single bullet point, he confuses theft, copyright infringement, patent infringement
                            and trademark infringement. And confuses us with Bethesda.</p>

                        <p>I am fine with the concept of &ldquo;owning stuff&rdquo;, so I&rsquo;m against theft. Society
                            breaks down if people can&rsquo;t &ldquo;own stuff&rdquo;.</p>
                        <p>I am mostly fine with the concept of &ldquo;selling stuff you made&rdquo;, so I&rsquo;m also
                            against copyright infringement. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s quite as bad as theft, and
                            I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s good for society that some professions can get paid over and
                            over long after they did the work (say, in the case of a game developer), whereas others
                            need to perform the job over and over to get paid (say, in the case of a hairdresser or a
                            lawyer). But yeah, &ldquo;selling stuff you made&rdquo; is good.</p>
                        <p>But there is no way in hell you can convince me that it&rsquo;s beneficial for society to not
                            share ideas. Ideas are free. They improve on old things, make them better, and this results
                            in all of society being better. Sharing ideas is how we improve.</p>
                        <p>A common argument for patents is that inventors won&rsquo;t invent unless they can protect
                            their ideas. The problem with this argument is that patents apply even if the infringer came
                            up with the idea independently. If the idea is that easy to think of, why do we need to
                            reward the person who happened to be first?</p>
                        <p>I will say that there are areas which are very costly to research, but where the benefits for
                            mankind long term are very positive. I would personally prefer it to have those be
                            government funded (like with CERN or NASA) and patent free as opposed to what&rsquo;s
                            happening with medicine, but I do understand why some people thing patents are good in these
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>Trivial patents, such as for software, are counterproductive (they slown down technical
                            advancement), evil (they sacrifice baby goats to baal), and costly (companies get tied up in
                            pointless lawsuits).</p>
                        <p>If you own a software patent, you should feel bad.</p>

                        <p>So in an interview, Double Fine lead Tim Schafer mentioned that they wanted to make
                            Psychonauts 2 happen, but that nobody had been willing to fund it so far. Being a big fan of
                            the first one, and thinking a sequel could probably be profitable, I semi-jokingly tweeted
                            Tim about me funding a sequel.</p>
                        <p>And then the internet exploded. (Or at least my inbox did)</p>
                        <p>And then Double Fine did their highly successful kickstarter.</p>
                        <p>Here are the facts of what&rsquo;s happening now, from my perspective:<br />* Tim and I
                            haven&rsquo;t spoken much at all other than a couple of emails.<br />* We mentioned meeting
                            at GDC, I hope that will happen<br />* I assume Double Fine will be very busy for many
                            months with the kickstarter project<br />* The budget for doing a Psychonauts 2 is three
                            times higher than my initial impression<br />* A couple of other parties have mentioned also
                            being interested in investing in it<br />* I would not be investing in this as a charity. It
                            would be because I think the game would be profitable<br />* And naturally, I wouldn&rsquo;t
                            want to have any creative input in the game. It would be purely a high risk investment in a
                            project I believe in.</p>
                        <p>I have NO idea if this is actually going to happen. The kickstarter stuff obviously changes
                            the playing field a lot. Investing that incredibly high amount of money also requires a lot
                            of planing and discussion, and I&rsquo;ve never done anything like that before, but I do
                            have contacts and advisors to help me out.</p>
                        <p>All I know is that IF the numbers work out and IF they still want to do it and IF they
                            don&rsquo;t decide to self fund a sequel by doing more crowd funding (which is honestly what
                            I would&rsquo;ve done if I were them), I would be most interested in doing this type of
                            investment.</p>
                        <p>Point is, stop hyping over this, internet! You&rsquo;re going to scare me into doing things
                            secretly instead of being open and transparent via twitter. I am incredibly scared of the
                            very real risk of people feeling let down just because I took a chance at something that
                            doesn&rsquo;t end up panning out.</p>
                        <p>Also, I realize you won&rsquo;t stop hyping, so I&rsquo;ll just go into hiding for a few
                            years if it falls through.</p>

                        <p>We have no idea how you&rsquo;re playing the Minecraft.</p>
                        <p>Right now, the only way we can figure out roughly what people are doing with the game is to
                            track logins. Once you&rsquo;re logged in, we have no idea what happens.</p>
                        <p>I was thinking it would be awesomely cool to add some kind of player tracking to the game.
                            This would work by having the game connect to minecraft.net and send some anonymous and
                            non-private data about the game, such as current game mode (single player, multiplayer),
                            operating system (windows? mac?), how long you&rsquo;ve been playing for (so we know how
                            long a game session is), and whether or not you&rsquo;re playing the downloaded game, or the
                            applet on the webpage. It would probably connect every ten minutes or so so we can get some
                            semi-realtime data. We&rsquo;d share the data with the community, as usual.</p>
                        <p>Naturally, the data sent will be fully anonymous, so it wouldn&rsquo;t contain any session
                            information or your user name, and it wouldn&rsquo;t send any sensitive information that you
                            might not want to share.</p>
                        <p>Would you be ok with this? We&rsquo;d really appreciate having that data!</p>

                        <div class="post_title">Coding skill and the decline of stagnation</div>
                        <p>I am a decent programmer. I know a decent amount of computer science theory, I can type
                            correct code fairly easy. I don&rsquo;t let my classes expand too much. But I still struggle
                            some with math, and I have a tendency to have too many cross-dependencies in my code.</p>
                        <p>I used to think I was an awesome programmer. One of the best. After I made a game in the
                            first programming lesson in school, I got told to don&rsquo;t bother showing up for the
                            rest. I was the one who taught all my friends what big O notation is and how it&rsquo;s
                            useful, or why hashmaps can have an effective constant speed if used right.<br />When
                            someone told me I was a bad programmer, I got upset. My identity was based on being The Best
                            Programmer, and being accused of not being one was a huge insult. Of COURSE I wrote bad code
                            sometimes, but that was just sloppyness or part of some grand scheme, or some other weak
                            excuse.</p>
                        <p>When doing a programming test for a large US based game developer, I did well on most tests.
                            After the programming test, they told me it was obvious that I was intelligent, but also
                            that I was self-taught. I had to work on programming more carefully and think things through
                            before diving in, or I&rsquo;d have a hard time working in a large group. Externally, I
                            nodded politely. Internally, I was stunned and confused.</p>
                        <p>That kind of woke me up. Ever since, I&rsquo;ve been working on improving my coding skill.
                            During my work on Minecraft, I never really got a chance to try out new things, or play with
                            new tools, but these days I&rsquo;m really trying to learn new things and pick up better
                            habits as much as I can. And as a result, I&rsquo;m having even more fun with the
                            programming. At the moment, I&rsquo;m trying to tame GIT, playing around with MongoDB,
                            trying out some static code analysis tools, and have started working on making my code even
                            more modular and reusable.</p>
                        <p>The more I learn, the more I realize how little I know.</p>
                        <p>But. I still stubbornly believe the whole &ldquo;private members accessed via
                            accessors&rdquo; thing in java is bullcrap for internal projects. It adds piles of useless
                            boilerplate code for absolutely no gain when you can just right click a field and chose
                            &ldquo;add setter/getter&rdquo; if you NEED an accessor in the future.</p>
                        <p>Point is, SOPA sucks.</p>

                        <p>No, just kidding. Instead, I will ramble about working in teams.</p>
                        <p>Some people have asked me why we don&rsquo;t hire a lot more programmers to work on
                            Minecraft. The answer is that I think that would be an incredibly bad thing to do.. or at
                            least that it WOULD have been an incredibly bad thing to do. One reason why Minecraft has
                            managed to get as much personality as it does it that it&rsquo;s only been a couple of
                            fairly nerdy game developers working on it.</p>
                        <p>At first, it was just me, and the game really represented what I thought was fun. Later on,
                            Jens joined in and added his own personality to the game in a way that fit really well with
                            what I had done. Naturally, we took in a lot of external input (especially from players,
                            thank you all so much!), but the end result was still filtered through us, making sure it
                            was personal.</p>
                        <p>I guess in some sense, this is a big reason of why I like &ldquo;indie games&rdquo;. Or games
                            made by small teams, rather. I&rsquo;m growing more wary of using the term &ldquo;indie
                            games&rdquo;, as there are too many definitions of what that means&hellip; to me it means a
                            game made for the sake of exploring some game idea, made by a small team that wants to
                            express themselves.. But I digress..</p>
                        <p>On one hand, I could see how Minecraft has at this point grown to a level where it could use
                            some extra hands to work on it. There&rsquo;s a lot of infrastructure that needs to be done,
                            and a lot of the tone for the game is already set. On the other, I worry that having too
                            many developers on it could water it down. On the third, it could also mean less
                            &ldquo;quirks&rdquo; (bugs).. on the fourth, some of these quirks are what give the game a
                            personality. Score: &amp;e0. And so on.</p>
                        <p>I could argue back and forth forever, but what I really want to do as a developer, is to work
                            on games in tiny, tiny teams. It means less compromise when it comes to design. It means
                            more freedom when it comes to implementation.</p>
                        <p>At the moment, I am working on a bigger version of my Ludum Dare 22 entry, because I really
                            liked working in that code base. In the relatively near future, I expect to start work on a
                            new, bigger game. I will be the only programmer on that game until the game mechanics are
                            fleshed out and the tone is set. I do feel an enormous pressure to live up to the Minecraft
                            legacy, but I will try not to let that hold me back. I will keep focusing on just making
                            games I want to play.</p>
                        <p>Happy new year, Internet!</p>

                        <p>Looks to Internet Community &amp; Fellow Tech Leaders to Destroy Legislation We All Hate</p>
                        <p>STOCKHOLM, Sweden. (Dec. 23, 2011) - Mojang has never supported SOPA, the &ldquo;Stop Online
                            Piracy Act&rdquo; currently working its way through U.S. Congress.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;Overzealous and vaguely formulated attempts to fight online piracy is of the scariest
                            developments in online policies in recent times, which is why Mojang has been working to
                            help destroy this legislation - but we can clearly do better,&rdquo; Markus Persson,
                            Mojang&rsquo;s newly appointed Vacation Expert, said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very important that
                            all Internet stakeholders work together on this. Getting it right is worth the wait. Mojang
                            will support all efforts to make sure information stays free.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>Mojang and its General Counsel, Oxeye Games, have not in any way worked with federal
                            lawmakers for months to help craft revisions to legislation first introduced some three
                            years ago. As a non-US company, Mojang doesn&rsquo;t really have any big say about US
                            internal politics, but Persson says he concerned that this law and similar ones will affect
                            their ability to successfully do business online. It is of utmost importance that laws like
                            these are not allowed to affect free speech. <br /><br /> &ldquo;As a company that is all
                            about innovation, with our own technology and in support of our customers, Mojang is rooted
                            in the idea of free speech and believes 100 percent that the Internet is a key engine for
                            our new economy,&rdquo; said Persson.<br /><br /> In no changing its position, Mojang
                            remains steadfast in its promise to support security and stability of the Internet. In an
                            effort to eliminate any confusion about its decision not to reverse on SOPA though, Persson
                            has tweeted a silly image of himself in a santa hat.<br /><br /> &ldquo;Mojang has always
                            fought to preserve free speech and the freedom of information, and will continue to do so in
                            the future,&rdquo; Jones said. I mean Persson. Not Jones.</p>

                        <p>I&rsquo;ve talked about it before, and I&rsquo;ll talk about it again. Ludum Dare is an
                            amazing thing. It&rsquo;s basically a recurring (three times per year? Uh. Something like
                            that) competition where you&rsquo;re supposed to make a game from scratch in 48 hours, and
                            it just happened again this weekend. Everyone starts at the same time when the theme gets
                            announced, and then you try to make an as complete game as possible over the next two
                            days.<br />The people who submitted games then get to vote on all the other games in a
                            variety of categories, and a few weeks later the winners are announced.</p>
                        <p>I&rsquo;ve participated several times before with (not sure about the chronological order of

                            submitted, but the competition has slowly grown, and this year there has been over seven
                            hundred games made. That is amazing!

                            As usual, I had lots of fun, even if I couldn&rsquo;t really think of a good game that would
                            fit the theme of &ldquo;alone&rdquo;.. I ended up making a zelda-ish top down game with
                            crafting influences from Minecraft.</p>
                        <p>I&rsquo;ve never actually won Ludum Dare, nor do I think I should, as there are some
                            seriously talented people participating. A big part of the fun is to know other people are
                            struggling just as hard as you do, and that you get to see what everyone else has made after
                            you finish yours. There really is a great sense of community.</p>

                        <p>I&rsquo;ve been avoiding doing any kind of work recently in an attempt to reset my creative
                            batteries. I&rsquo;ve mostly been playing Zelda. Then I played <a
                                href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.remar.se%2Fdaniel%2Fpitch.php&amp;t=OWEwMzhkMzdkNjZhMWJhNWUwYTMzNjc3MTViY2JlMTEwYzc5Yzk5OCxnYUc4dzROUw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F14118028707%2Fsanta-vs-cthulhu-until-7-am">Hyper
                                Princess Pitch</a> and started playing around with the idea of making a Christmas game
                            myself. Naturally, I started with the title. Santa vs Cthulhu.</p>
                        <p>The original idea was to make a real time strategy game where you play as either Santa or
                            Cthulhu, building elves and manics, converting houses for your purpose (cheer or ia). But it
                            was hard to pick a setting for it. Santa obviously lives on the north pole, but there
                            aren&rsquo;t many houses there, and there certainly aren&rsquo;t any deep oceans for any
                            Ancient Ones to awaken from.</p>
                        <p>I gave up on the idea, until last night. I got this idea that using the Geoscape from x-com
                            would better fit the scope. Santa would start with a base on the north pole, Cthulhu would
                            start somewhere in the south pacific. They&rsquo;d both spend time improving their base and
                            recruiting cities. Combat would take place in the RTS game I initially imagined. I got
                            excited about the idea, as it would allow me to make fun of/pay tribute to two games I
                            really loved growing up, UFO: Enemy Unknown and Dune 2. Sadly, the game seemed a bit too
                            complex for me to make in time for Christmas, so I abandoned the idea.</p>
                        <p>But what if I ditched the RTS bit? Just focus on base building and sending out scouting
                            parties to look for Cthulian infestation or to cheer up a nearby city? Combat would be
                            resolved automatically with a brief combat summary, perhaps. Yes, this seemed like a much
                            more feasible game, and it&rsquo;d be much more focused as well.</p>
                        <p>This ended up with me programming the entire night. I found an old textured polygon software
                            renderer I had written a few years ago and rescued it from its project. It ran pretty fast,

                        <p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure I won&rsquo;t actually be able to make this game in time for christmas
                            (Ludum Dare this upcoming weekend will take up a lot of the remaining time, and I definitely
                            want to do that), but I had a great night of programming last night. I really missed being
                            able to dig myself deep into some obscure programming challenge and spend the entire night
                            working on it.</p>
                        <p>Besides, if doing the game quickly was my primary motivator, I wouldn&rsquo;t have gone for
                            the fancy polygonal approach. I just would&rsquo;ve written a simple screen coordinate -&gt;
                            spherical coordinate lookup table thing that maps each pixel to a position on the globe (or
                            to nothing, if it&rsquo;s outside the globe).</p>

                            that we&rsquo;re only looking for developers at this point)</p>
                        <p>Here are the top five reasons you should work at Mojang:</p>
                        <p>5) We&rsquo;re less serious than many other companies. We rely on having a pool of talent
                            rather than long discussions, and make decisions very organically and spontaneously.</p>
                        <p>4) We encourage people at Mojang to speak publicly about what they do and have a personal
                            connection with the players.</p>
                        <p>3) Tobias M&ouml;llstam</p>
                        <p>2) We have mandatory gaming Friday afternoons. Working after lunch on Fridays is frowned
                            upon.</p>
                        <p>1) Mojang&rsquo;s mission statement is &ldquo;Mojang shall be the most influential indie game
                            development studio on Earth&rdquo;, and we intend to live up to that. I kid you not.</p>

                        <p>As of yesterday, Jens Bergensten is the new lead developer on Minecraft. He will have the
                            final say in all design decisions, so he will kinda sorta become my boss, I guess.
                            I&rsquo;ve promised him to not pull rank. ;)</p>
                        <p>We&rsquo;ve been working together on Minecraft for a year now, and I&rsquo;m amazed at how
                            much in synch we two are when it comes to how to design the game. And when we don&rsquo;t
                            agree, we discuss it and something much better comes out at a result. He&rsquo;s truly a
                            great person to work with, and I feel very confident handing over the leadership of
                            Minecraft to him.</p>
                        <p>If you want to contact Jens, he&rsquo;s on twitter as <a

                        <p>Personally, I will now rest for a while, then get back to work refreshed and eager.
                            I&rsquo;ll be helping out with Minecraft, of course, but also starting work on some new
                            project.</p>

                        <div class="post_title">I love Team Fortress 2</div>
                        <p>Back before the Orange Box, I kept hyping TF2 to all my friends. I had played a lot of TF and
                            TFC back in the day, and I knew TF2 would be the greatest thing ever. My friends humored me
                            and got it on the beta with me. And my god was it awesome. It was awesomer than awesome!</p>
                        <p>Way later, I went through this period of not really enjoying TF2 as much as I had. After
                            spending hundreds of hours on a game, I guess that&rsquo;s bound to happen.</p>
                        <p>A while back, I started playing it a bit now and again to see what was new. And it scared me
                            a bit. The game I remembered with sentries glitched under the floor and sidecrits
                            wasn&rsquo;t there. Now it was all swords and space guns and engineers protecting spots
                            nobody was playing anywhere near. But something was there. It was still fun.</p>
                        <p>Then I got invited to play in the third TF2 Mixup (<a
                                href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tf2mixup.com%2Fmatch%2FMixup3&amp;t=MTY5MDdhN2RkOGE3MTQ1MGM1OGFhNmI4OTk5YWMxOGU5MTlhNDA3OSxwZjJJSGZteQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F13353738451%2Fi-love-team-fortress-2">watch
                                it here</a>) with a bunch of famous TF2 personalities. Robin Walker, my third favorite
                            person at Valve, was there, and kept killing me with his super hax. And by golly did I have
                            a great time!</p>
                        <p>So I kept playing, and I kept having fun. Playing with ez in the other room is lots of fun,
                            and the game seems to for some reason have gotten a lot easier since it went free to play.
                            Ahem. I got the <a

                        <div class="post_title">Kelvin is awesome. Celsius and Fahrenheit are silly.</div>
                        <p>Some time many years ago, we decided to measure something that has a zero value on a scale
                            where zero isn&rsquo;t at the zero value. A temperature of <em>no heat at all</em> is -273
                            and -460 in degrees Celsius and degrees Fahrenheit respectively. This makes no sense. None.
                        </p>
                        <p>In Kelvin, a total lack of heat is exactly 0 K. This makes sense. The lack of distance is
                            exactly 0 meters. And 0 yards. And 0 parsecs.</p>
                        <p>So the obvious solution is to either switch everyone over to Kelvin (or Rankine if
                            you&rsquo;re a hipster), or to change introduce a new measurement for distance that has the
                            zero point at some other value than <em>no distance at all</em>.</p>
                        <p>I suggest the Flen, based off the human body. 0 Flen is exactly 1.76 meters, because that
                            happens to be my length. 1 Flen is 2.76 meters. -1.76 Flen is 0 meters, or a total lack of
                            distance.</p>
                        <p>Some measurements in Flen:<br />Diameter of CD-Rom: -1.64 Flen<br />Length of Notch: 0
                            Flen<br />Length of Jakob: 0.02 Flen<br />Height of Eiffel Tower: 322.4 Flen</p>

                        <p>I am incredibly tired right now, so this might be a bit short. ;)</p>
                        <p>Breakfast was at 8 am, being filmed by CNN. People were looking tired, but happy, and me and
                            Jakob had bacon with far too much Tabasco sauce on. Then I went and did an interview with
                            CNN, finishing with playing some Minecraft next to a fan. I went back to signing stuff for
                            two hours.</p>
                        <p>Then there was the charity lunch. The food was excellent, and everyone there had paid a lot
                            of money that later got donated to the Make A Wish Foundation. I ended up signing even more
                            stuff at that lunch.</p>
                        <p>After lunch, I did an interview with Machinima, followed by me heading over the backstage
                            area of the closing session thing. I got even more things to sign there, for IGN and
                            something else I forget what it was. The closing session got delayed 20 minutes due to total
                            chaos, but we eventually got on stage and thanked everyone for coming, thanked the sponsors,
                            gave away a huge fake check to Make A Wish, and brought a guy and his girlfriend up on stage
                            for a proposal. She said yes.</p>
                        <p>And then we were done. We had some beer and champagne, and now we get to rest. Elin and I
                            just ordered room service, and will take a short nap.</p>
                        <p>Then there&rsquo;s the party tonight. It&rsquo;s going to be crazy.</p>

                        <p>After some seven hours of sleep (nice), we went to the wrong room for breakfast. Confusion
                            started setting in until someone figured it out. Breakfast in the USA apparently consisted
                            of cake bread with peanut butter and jam, and extremely crispy bacon. I am not complaining.
                        </p>
                        <p>We went to rehearse the opening session, and I got mic:ed up by what I think was CNN, who are
                            filming something about something. I tried to pay attention, but so much was going on, I
                            kinda faked understanding what was happening. There was a big minecraft lever on stage that
                            I had to pull, timed to a snare drum / bass drum kick in a song. I couldn&rsquo;t pull it
                            too hard, or it would pop out, as it wasn&rsquo;t actually held in place by anything other
                            than pressure from the material on the sides of it.</p>
                        <p>We had lunch backstage, I had some refreshing beverages to soothe my nerves, and then fans
                            started filling the room for the opening ceremony. Thousands of them. My personal security
                            guard (provided by the hotel) also arrived. His job is to help me get from place to place
                            when I need to go somewhere without getting mobbed, and to make sure I&rsquo;m
                            &ldquo;safe&rdquo;. Turns out he&rsquo;s been a cop for many years, so he had awesome
                            authority just by looking at people. He&rsquo;s done stuff like this for a long time.</p>
                        <p>The opening ceremony went well. We started with an opening trailer by Hat Films, watched a
                            video by Captain Sparkles, listened to Stuart Platt from Microsoft who showed the Minecraft
                            Xbox 360 trailer (also made by Hat Films), listened to Daniel talk about the iOS version,
                            then we introduced everyone at Mojang. Then Mega64 came on and played their Minecraft 1.0
                            release funny video type of thing. It was funny :D. I got to be mocked by Rocco, which has
                            been a goal of mine for a long time.</p>
                        <p>I got a standing ovation when I came on stage. There&rsquo;s no way to deal with that.
                            Emotions ran wild. Then I did a short talk, then we pulled the lever, and I ran off to watch
                            my sister get married, Vegas style.</p>
                        <p>After the wedding, we had the Mojang Panel where the Oxeye team talked about Cobalt, the
                            Scrolls team talked about Scrolls, then everyone from Mojang answered questions from the
                            audience. Or rather, Jakob, Mattis, Jens and I answered questions. The rest mostly just sat
                            there. ;)</p>
                        <p>A quick snack later, we went to the main expo hall and sat down in the signing/taking
                            pictures area, and spent a total of three hours signing stuff as fast as we could. It was
                            absolutely crazy, with the queue leading all the way around the hall, out the doors, and all
                            the way over to the stairs. Since we had to cut the line when we started running out of
                            time, the volunteers handed out tickets for everyone who couldn&rsquo;t reach the front in
                            time. We&rsquo;ll have a special signing session just for them today at 11 am.</p>
                        <p>We ended the night in our common Media Suite, where there was food and drinks. I didn&rsquo;t
                            last long before leaving for bed.</p>
                        <p>Then I slept.</p>

                            three hours or so, but never managed to go back to sleep. Too many thoughts, too much
                            jetlag. The sunset was very beautiful from our hotel room. At about 7 am or so, Elin and I
                            called our family members, and we all gathered in our suite before going down to eat
                            breakfast. And let me tell you, breakfast buffets in Vegas are pretty darn awesome.</p>
                        <p>Then I did some gambling and met some fans. So far I&rsquo;m up $130, all on slot machines.
                            My plan is to either gamble all of that winning away or stop if I happen to hit $1000. I
                            fully expect to lose it.</p>
                        <p>Everyone from Mojang met up at noon to go through the convention center. I got lost several
                            times over while doing so, so I don&rsquo;t actually remember where anything of it was. But
                            it sure was starting to look impressive. Someone told me that Minecraft for iOS had
                            accidentally been released early and that it was the second most grossing app. The original
                            plan was to reveal it as a secret thing during the opening ceremony. A bit later, it was the
                            top grossing app.</p>
                        <p>I spend 45 minutes streaming the preparations to twitch.tv. I would stream more during the
                            event, but we&rsquo;ve asked ign to be our exclusive streaming partner, and I don&rsquo;t
                            want to do anything they&rsquo;re not ok with. If I see them, I will ask, and perhaps do
                            some more streaming today.</p>
                        <p>We did a rehearsal press event thing, then the actual press event thing. I did a few
                            interviews that got progressively more silly as the day went on. Most of the Yogscast
                            interview was spent talking about Simon&rsquo;s mother, and I slapped myself twice during
                            the one with Hat Films.</p>
                        <p>Then a few of us gathered in our suite again to get some room service, and ended up ordering
                            way too much food. The nachos were awesome. Then I called Carl and cancelled the final thing
                            I was supposed to do that day (record some video with &lt;SECRET&gt;) and fell asleep.</p>
                        <p>When I woke up, I heard we got a 10/10 review for Minecraft from Eurogamer. <a

                        <p>The phone alarm rang at half past seven in the morning. Two hours later we were at Arlanda
                            Airport and met up with the rest of the Mojang Team. We did some last minute shopping (power
                            plug converters and toothpaste), had breakfast, then got on the flight to Heathrow Airport
                            where we bought even more power plug converter thingies.</p>
                        <p>The second flight went all the way to Las Vegas. I have to say, British Airways has fairly
                            decent airplane food, and the business class seats are amazing. I played some Skyrim on my
                            MacBook Air, but I had turned down the settings so low the game actually became a bit
                            annoying to play. In large indoors areas, the entire far area of the room would unload and
                            just look like a skybox. So I gave up on that and played VVVVVV and Super Meat Boy instead.
                            Luckily, I had brought an XBox 360 controller.</p>
                        <p>In Vegas, there were limos waiting to drive us to Mandalay Bay. Me and Elin got a really nice
                            corner suite with a 180 degree panorama view of Las Vegas. We got a few free awesome rooms
                            because of the convention, so I made sure to grab a good one for myself. Carl got something
                            called a &ldquo;presidential suite&rdquo;, which everyone assumed would be a huge suite with
                            lots of space. Turns out it was way smaller than the one me and Elin got, but we still had
                            the first mojang gathering in Vegas in that room. There was pizza, fries, buffalo wings, dip
                            sauces, and plenty of beverages. Deadmau5 was there and we talked a bit about the party on
                            Saturday, which is going to be incredibly awesome.</p>
                        <p>Danny Baranowsky and Petri Purho stopped by, and Kyle Whatshisface from J!NX decided to
                            tackle hug me while I was just barely able to stay awake. That was about my cue to head back
                            to the hotel room and try to get some sleep. ;)</p>
                        <p>It&rsquo;s not 3:30 am, and the jetlag is playing with me. I&rsquo;ve never been more awake
                            in my entire life.</p>

                        <p>(First of all, sorry about the masturbation joke in my last post. It&rsquo;s currently my
                            favorite joke. :D)</p>
                        <p>It&rsquo;s 10 pm. In 10.5 hours, we will leave for Arlanda Airport. Soon thereafter, we will
                            fly to Las Vegas!</p>
                        <p>The last few weeks have been incredibly stressful and emotional in many ways, and I feel so
                            relieved to finally have a finished version of Minecraft to release to the world on Friday.
                            But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we&rsquo;ll stop working on Minecraft! We&rsquo;ll keep adding
                            to the game just as we have so far, and we have many exciting plans for the next year.. some
                            of these will be announced fairly soon.</p>
                        <p>One thing that kind of fell between chairs is the mod support.. Sorry about that, I take full
                            responsibility for letting that get forgotten about. But when it comes to the new launcher,
                            it got folded into a new exciting project I won&rsquo;t talk about yet.</p>
                        <p>But back to Minecon! For me personally, it&rsquo;s going to be three full days of chaos and
                            fans, which will probably leave me extremely tired. Then there&rsquo;s a big party with a
                            huge celebrity act playing. And then I get to relax. I plan on playing a LOT of games this
                            winter.. Battlefield 3, Saints Row The Third, Diablo 3, Skyward Sword, and biggest of all,
                            Skyrim.</p>
                        <p>Skyrim, SkyrimSkyrim Skyrim Skyrim SkyrimSkyrimSkyrim. Skyrim.</p>

                        <p>A normal project for me goes through three stages. I will summarize and review them because
                            I&rsquo;m waiting for a very slow script to finish and have nothing better to do! :D</p>
                        <p><strong>Inspiration!</strong><br />Ah! A new idea! I think I know how I could do an awesome
                            thing, or there&rsquo;s a new aspect I want to try with an existing feature. Development
                            speed is amazingly high and new ideas get thrown around. Some of it might not be perfect,
                            and there&rsquo;s a significant risk of abandoning the project at this stage.</p>
                        <p>Fun: 5/5<br />Usefulness: 2/5<br />Fulfillment: 5/5<br />Productivity: 4/5</p>
                        <p><strong>Motivation!</strong><br />After the initial stage of inspiration, the project moves
                            into the motivation driven phase. Features get tweaked and polished, and the overall design
                            gets a final overhaul. Some boring things get pushed up until later, if
                            possible.<br /><br />Fun: 3/5<br />Usefulness: 3/5<br />Fulfillment: 3/5<br />Productivity:
                            5/5</p>
                        <p><strong>Stress!<br /></strong>Suddenly I realize I need to finish the feature! Doubt sets in,
                            and some deadline starts looming. Is it good enough? Is it even usable? Productivity drops
                            suddenly, and the major motivator becomes just getting it done before the deadline. This
                            usually leads to last minute work. Despite this, much of the work ends up being actually
                            very good.</p>
                        <p>Fun: 1/5<br />Usefulness: 3/5<br />Fulfillment: 2/5<br />Productivity: 1/5</p>
                        <p><strong>Abandonment!</strong><br />Eventually, the project is considered &ldquo;good
                            enough&rdquo;, or the deadline passes, and whatever is there will just have to serve as the
                            final version. Sure, I could spend infinitely more time working on it, but new projects are
                            either deemed more important, or some new inspiration sets in. The project is wrapped up and
                            released.</p>

                        <p>Next week is MineCon week. That means we&rsquo;ll release the full version of Minecraft
                            (which will be called &ldquo;Minecraft&rdquo;, and have a version number of 1.0. The current
                            version is &ldquo;Minecraft Beta&rdquo;). We&rsquo;ll keep working on Minecraft for a long
                            time after the full release, but it&rsquo;s a huge milestone.</p>
                        <p>That milestone also means people might start reviewing the game. There have been a few
                            reviews already, but I have a feeling most people are waiting for the full release.</p>
                        <p>This makes me nervous.</p>
                        <p>It does feel like the game has already proven itself. Lots of people play the game, and we
                            receive a lot of friendly and positive emails from players. We&rsquo;ve won several amazing
                            awards, so several people in the industry seems to enjoy what we&rsquo;ve done.<br />Now
                            it&rsquo;s just the press left.</p>
                        <p>It&rsquo;s a bit weird, but gaming scores have become so big and bloated, I can&rsquo;t help
                            but feel like I would be disappointed with a score that would be a great score for something
                            like a movie or a music album. And even if the score means relatively little compared to the
                            players and the awards, it&rsquo;s a distinct number people will use to compare the game to
                            other games.</p>
                        <p>But what REALLY makes me nervous is the fact that I&rsquo;m going to have to do at least some
                            public speaking at MineCon. I&rsquo;m fine with meeting fans and signing stuff, and even
                            with having my picture taken, but standing on stage and trying to get a point across really
                            terrifies me.</p>

                        <p>Ok, so.. For a long time, I&rsquo;ve claimed that obviously the egg came before the chicken,
                            as the first chicken had to be hatched from something.</p>
                        <p>We had a discussion about it today at work, and Jens contested that claim. So now I&rsquo;ve
                            revised my position.</p>
                        <p>Chicken can lay eggs without them being fertilized. This means the eggs are made up of
                            non-genetically-mixed material, and that the fertilization alters the contents of the eggs
                            (the thing that gets hatched).</p>
                        <p>This means that some kind of proto-chicken got fertilized, laid a proto-chicken egg that
                            contained a mutated offspring that we would today call a chicken.</p>
                        <p>So obviously, the chicken came first. QEFD.</p>

                        <div class="post_title">I hate &quot;free to play&quot;.</div>
                        <p>Ok, that headline it a bit overly inflammatory. While I am sceptical of the free to play
                            trend, what I hate is the wording &ldquo;free to play&rdquo;.</p>
                        <p>The reason some people are moving to this area is that free to play showed up in the
                            &ldquo;social gaming&rdquo; segment (facebook) and made a few people (zynga) very rich.
                            It&rsquo;s been tried in other genres in other markets with decent success. By
                            &ldquo;success&rdquo;, I mean &ldquo;it&rsquo;s profitable&rdquo;.
                            The reason anyone switches to &ldquo;free to play&rdquo; is to make more money. You get your
                            players hooked on your game, and then you try to monetize them. The idea is to find a model
                            where there basically is no cap on how much the player can spend, then try to encourage
                            players to spend more and more money. Various psyhological traps like abusing the sense of
                            sunk costs get exploited, and eventually you end up with a game that&rsquo;s designed more
                            like a slot machine than half-life 2.</p>
                        <p>So instead of calling it &ldquo;free to play&rdquo;, we should call it &ldquo;as expensive as
                            you want it to be&rdquo; or something.</p>
                        <p>I do not mind paying for games after the purchase. I like customizing my character, or
                            getting a few extra levels (DX HR:Missing Link, woo!), or even paying a subscription cost
                            for something with running costs.</p>
                        <p>But let&rsquo;s get one thing clear: people who think &ldquo;free to play&rdquo; is a great
                            future are mostly game developers, not game players.</p>
                        <p>I&rsquo;ll go play some team fortress 2 now until dota 2 is released. I can&rsquo;t wait!! =D

                        <p>One year ago, we started Mojang. Back then, Minecraft had sold between half a million and one
                            million copies, and now we&rsquo;re up to almost four million copies sold, we&rsquo;re
                            expanding to two new platforms, and we&rsquo;re getting good progress done with our new
                            game. In one month, we&rsquo;re going to Las Vegas to celebrate the full release of
                            Minecraft with our fans. And we&rsquo;re getting sued by one of my favorite game developers.
                        </p>
                        <p>I started working on Minecraft in the summer of 2009, starting with a top-down isometric
                            mining game. The elevator pitch for the game was &ldquo;Dwarf Fortress meets Rollercoaster
                            Tycoon meets Dungeon Keeper&rdquo;. It was an interesting game for sure that I&rsquo;d still
                            like to see someone make, but then I played a game called Infiniminer and realized the first
                            person perspective with blocky graphics worked really well and started prototyping it. The
                            game went from being about controlling a team of characters to being a single player first
                            person experience, with a focus on resource gathering and a somewhat coherent fantasy
                            setting that would provide hopefully constant challenges and things to do.</p>
                        <p>After a little more than half a year of working on the game, people started talking about it
                            and paying attention to it, so I was able to quit my day job and focus on it full time. I
                            got flown out to Seattle to talk to Valve (and Bungie, as a bonus! :D). Valve&rsquo;s one of
                            the places I&rsquo;d absolutely love to work at, the people are really nice and creative,
                            and their new offices are amazingly nerd friendly. But I decided to instead focus on doing
                            my own thing, called Jakob, and told him to quit his job.</p>
                        <p>Daniel joined, then Carl, then me and Jakob took a short field trip to Uppsala to meet with
                            Junkboy, then Daniel suggested Jens, and all of the sudden we&rsquo;re 12 people in the
                            office, with three more signed up. We&rsquo;re looking for a bigger office now. Fun!</p>
                        <p>We&rsquo;re officially one year old now, and things are more fun than ever. :D Thank you,
                            everyone working at Mojang. You may miss morning meetings sometimes, and some of you have
                            horrible taste in music, but I love you all! And, of course, none of this would&rsquo;ve
                            been possible without the players and the fans, so thank you, person reading this!</p>
                        <p>Also, we&rsquo;ve won a big pile of awards. ;-D</p>

                        <p>The adventure update is going great! We&rsquo;re adding features and cramming in content, and
                            then started feature creeping and content creeping. What we&rsquo;ve got on our hands now is
                            somewhere in between a finished Adventure Mode update and a version of the game we&rsquo;d
                            be proud to call just &ldquo;Minecraft&rdquo;. Not &ldquo;Minecraft Beta&rdquo; or
                            &ldquo;Minecraft Alpha&rdquo;, but just plain and simple &ldquo;Minecraft&rdquo;.</p>
                        <p>And we&rsquo;re going to release that version of the game live on stage in Vegas at MineCon!
                            Woooo!</p>
                        <p>Up until then, instead of trying to squeeze in another real release, we&rsquo;re going to do
                            weekly (or so) pre releases, aimed at advanced players. We release these via twitter, so
                            make sure to follow me (@notch) and Jens (@jeb_) if you&rsquo;re interested in those.</p>
                        <p>Also, we&rsquo;re finally adding a dragon.</p>

                        <p>I feel the need to clarify a couple of things:</p>
                        <p>We realized we should apply for the trademark &ldquo;Minecraft&rdquo; to protect our brand.
                            When doing so, we also sent in an application for &ldquo;Scrolls&rdquo;. When Bethesda
                            contacted us, we offered both to change the name to &ldquo;Scrolls: &lt;some
                            subtitle&gt;&rdquo; and to give up the trademark.</p>
                        <p>They refused on both counts.</p>
                        <p>Whatever reason they have for suing us, it&rsquo;s not a fear of us having a trademark on the
                            word &ldquo;Scrolls&rdquo;, as we&rsquo;ve offered to give that up.</p>

                        <p>There are many games like this (captive, hired guns, ishar, might and magic, wizardry, most
                            of the gold box games, and so on), but these are the games all capture a certain common
                            theme and feeling in a way that hasn&rsquo;t really been done before or since.</p>
                        <p><strong>Dungeon Master</strong> (1987)<br />A fairly straight forward first person dungeon
                            crawler where going deeper means getting closer to your goal. Gameplay consists of pushing
                            buttons, sidestepping monsters and drinking potions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Eye of the Beholder </strong>(1991)<strong><br /></strong>A fairly straight forward
                            first person dungeon crawler where going deeper means getting closer to your goal. Gameplay
                            consists of pushing buttons, sidestepping monsters and drinking potions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Eye of the Beholder II&nbsp; - The Legend of Darkmoon</strong> (1992)<br />An evolved
                            version of the original. This time you have to explore different branches and return to the
                            central hub. The boss fight is epic, and the graphics are much better this time around.</p>
                        <p><strong>Dungeon Master II - The Legend of Skullkeep</strong> (1993)<br /> An evolved version
                            of the original. This time you have to explore different branches and return to the central
                            hub. The boss fight is epic, and the graphics are much better this time around.</p>
                        <p><strong>Eye of the Beholder III - Assault on Myth Drannor </strong>(1993)<br />More of the
                            same, except this time it isn&rsquo;t fun. The charm is gone. Where is the charm?</p>
                        <p><strong>Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos </strong>(1993)<br />Oh, there it is!</p>
                        <p>And then the genre died. Sure, there were more dungeon crawlers, but they were all too
                            complex. Dungeon Master II is one of the best games ever made. With every new game release,
                            I hope to experience something like it again, but it&rsquo;s never the same.</p>
                        <p>But now, something wonderful is happening. A small Finnish studio&nbsp; is making a game
                            called Legend of Grimrock (<a
                                href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.grimrock.net%2F&amp;t=NWI3ODMwN2E3NzBiMWJjNmI2ZjM3NjU3YzRkZjJlNzE0NTMzY2QxNiwwTkxVYjU5YQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F10929498601%2Freal-games-for-nerdy-gamers">http://www.grimrock.net/</a>),
                            and it&rsquo;s looking amazing. I realize it&rsquo;s a niche game that might not fit
                            everyone, but to me it is one of the most exciting games in development.</p>
                        <p>I am very excited!</p>
                        <p>(.. but why do they have the free look camera? :-/)</p>

                        <p>Me and Jens have only two more major features we want to implement before the release in
                            November. The plan it to stop all new development on October 18, and resume them again after
                            the release on November 18. That will give us one month to focus on just fixing bugs,
                            cleaning up the code, and optimizing the performance to make sure the release will be as
                            good as possible.</p>
                        <p>Celebrating the full version with the fan is going to be an amazing experience. I am a bit
                            nervous about it, to be honest. I&rsquo;m not sure how many people are going, and I&rsquo;m
                            terrified of public speaking. I can handle one-on-one discussions or handshakes, and I can
                            even deal with giving autographs, but when it gets too big, I just start freaking out.</p>
                        <p>Carl and Lydia have been doing an amazing job organizing it all, with plenty of help from Vu
                            and Meeting Expectations. To keep up with the latest news there, follow <a

                            can&rsquo;t reach an agreement, so we&rsquo;re going to court. I&rsquo;m personally very
                            opinionated about things like these. I asked our lawyers, and apparently the documents
                            ZeniMax submitted became public once they were filed.</p>
                        <p>So here they are: <a

                        <p>It&rsquo;s in Swedish, it&rsquo;s unedited, and I haven&rsquo;t read it myself. Our lawyers
                            have, though.</p>
                        <p>Speaking of lawyers, they told me that:</p>

                            to be confused into thinking that our &ldquo;Scrolls&rdquo; game is connected with Bethesda
                            or its games, taking all the circumstances into account; and<br />2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                        <p>I&rsquo;ve invented a computer that solves NP problems in constant time. I call it the Mass
                            Quantum Suicide Computer, or the MQSC for short.</p>
                        <p>You know Schr&ouml;dingers Cat? The one in the box that is both alive and dead until you
                            observe it? There&rsquo;s a similar thought experiment in which you place yourself in the
                            box and observe what happens. This is called &ldquo;Quantum Suicide&rdquo;. According to
                            some interpretations, you will only ever observe yourself surviving, because in all other
                            universes, your consciousness isn&rsquo;t around to observe yourself being dead. This leads
                            to another concept called &ldquo;Quantum Immortality&rdquo;, which basically means that for
                            any lethal situation, if there&rsquo;s any chance at all of you surviving it, you will only
                            ever experience the universes in which you do. Of course, all your friends and family will
                            still see you die in the vast majority of universes.</p>
                        <p>Unless you take them with you. Which I call &ldquo;Mass Quantum Suicide&rdquo;. Basically,
                            you put the entire human race in the box, and you will all either die together or survive
                            together.</p>
                        <p>So here&rsquo;s my computer:</p>
                        <p>1) Ask the computer any question.<br />2) The computer has a one in &lt;very, very, very
                            large number&gt; chance of just saying &ldquo;try again&rdquo;. If it does, go back to
                            1.<br />3) The computer spits out a random reply.<br />4) Assume this reply is the correct
                            answer, and leave the computer alone until it&rsquo;s verified that it actually was the
                            correct answer.<br />5) The computer then spends as long time as it needs verifying that the
                            reply is correct.<br />6) If the random reply turns out to be incorrect, destroy the
                            universe. This can be done by, for example, setting of a true vacuum chain reaction.</p>
                        <p>In all universes where humans are still around, the computer will always either say
                            &ldquo;try again&rdquo;, or spit out the correct answer immediately. Nobody will be around
                            to observe the universes where it guesses wrong.</p>
                        <p>This computer works great for NP problems which are quick to verify that you have the correct
                            answer for, as you don&rsquo;t have to leave the computer alone for very long in between
                            asking it a question.</p>
                        <p>[EDIT:]</p>
                        <p>I thought this was an original idea, but it&rsquo;s been done before:<br /><a

                        <p>I&rsquo;ve received some questions about what the status of the Bethesda lawsuit thing is. I
                            don&rsquo;t have much news, but I can try to summarize the recent events in a colorful way:
                        </p>
                        <p>Lawyers have been sending papers back and forth, threatening each other with deadlines and
                            court dates. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we settle this in a mature way?&rdquo;, one party asks
                            the other. &ldquo;Your MOTHER settles things in mature ways&rdquo;, the other party cleverly
                            retorts, &ldquo;because of her age.&rdquo;<br />Last thing I heard, we were a couple of
                            weeks past a &ldquo;super seriously, we will sue you for real this time&rdquo; deadline, and
                            letters are still being sent back and forth.</p>
                        <p>In other news, here&rsquo;s a list of games I&rsquo;ve been playing recently, and my thoughts
                            on them:</p>
                        <p><strong>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</strong><br />Charmingly retro, with a totally rubbish
                            tranq sniper rifle. Unfair boss fights, fun level layout. The level up perks are kind of
                            uninteresting, but it&rsquo;s still a lot of fun. Inventory management feels very Resident
                            Evil 4, for good and for bad.<br />[edit: This makes it sound like I don&rsquo;t like the
                            game! That is incorrect. I love it!!]</p>
                        <p><strong>Legends of Yore<br /></strong>I&rsquo;m just getting started playing this more
                            seriously. It&rsquo;s a low res graphical roguelike made by one guy who I happen to know.
                            Available on both phone types and on pc. I haven&rsquo;t gotten deep into it yet, but it
                            seems to have everything I want.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Binding of Isaac<br /></strong>I got sneak peeks of this game, and it&rsquo;s
                            shaping up nicely. It&rsquo;s a very lightweight action roguelike with plenty of dark humor
                            and zelda references. Danny B&rsquo;s done a great job on the soundtrack again, even if it
                            makes me a bit depressed.</p>
                        <p><strong>Diablo III Beta<br /></strong>No, just kidding, I didn&rsquo;t get in. :(</p>

                        <p>Game development is fun. There&rsquo;s programming, design, testing and just plain good old
                            silliness. Here&rsquo;s a brief snapshot - a retelling of what I did this weekend!</p>
                        <p>I was putting in a few extra hours on Minecraft this weekend, refactoring code so biomes
                            could directly decorate the terrain themselves rather than having the terrain check the
                            biomes manually. That type of work is mostly just busy work, so it wasn&rsquo;t very
                            interesting from a design perspective, but it was very rewarding form a programming
                            perspective. Things were starting to fall into place, and biomes became much
                            &ldquo;cleaner&rdquo;.</p>
                        <p>One of the results of that was the first draft of a swamp biome, which I posted a screenshot
                            of. I got crazy amounts of great feedback on how to make it look swampier (it kinda looks
                            like a happy grove at the moment), and almost all of them are entirely doable by only
                            changing the SwampBiome.java class. Feels good!</p>
                        <p>While testing the biome code, I started running out of food in the game and started hunting
                            animals. Cows would just stand there, looking at me as I mashed them over and over to get
                            their precious loot, so I figured I&rsquo;d just make that mechanic a bit more fun. Four
                            lines of code later, and animals now flee randomly after taking damage. Hunting animals
                            suddenly became a lot more fun and morally questionable as pigs would storm off grunting and
                            chicken (or whatever the heck they are) would jump into ravines. But the real fun came later
                            on.</p>
                        <p>Someone tweeted me about a joking campaign to add 3d modeled snouts to the pigs in Minecraft,
                            so I did. While doing so, I groaned at how the Cube class has an &ldquo;addBox&rdquo; method
                            that actually means &ldquo;replaceBox&rdquo;, and how it really should be a
                            &ldquo;Shape&rdquo; class with an &ldquo;addBox&rdquo; method that actually does what it
                            says. Right now every box in a model has to be individually animated to match the part
                            it&rsquo;s attached to, and there&rsquo;s no grouping or hierarcy. This is the reason why
                            the horns on the cows are in the wrong location sometimes. I didn&rsquo;t fix the code for
                            this, as I was running out of weekend, but I made a mental note to fix it asap.</p>
                        <p>Reddit loved my pic of a pig with a 3d snout. I got sooo much precious link karma.</p>
                        <p>Back to doing some further testing. I was exploring a forest biome, hit upon a river cutting
                            through it, and walked over a small hill. On the other side, a wolf was chasing a sheep, but
                            the sheep was running away. I didn&rsquo;t have this in mind when I wrote the code to make
                            mobs flee, but it ended up giving me an unexpected experience of having some kind of echo
                            system of competing behaviors in various animals, and it just felt.. nice. It made me
                            realize we should explore more mob to mob interactions, and have more chaotic competing
                            behavior.</p>
                        <p>I&rsquo;m doing a high priority secret project this week (a prototype for a future possible
                            project), but I already have at least three things I want to work on as soon as I get back
                            on Minecraft work next week.</p>
                        <p>The reason it&rsquo;s still fun is you. The community. Thank you. &lt;3</p>

                        <p>One early summer morning, Carl was on vacation and I was checking my email. Lydia, who was
                            organizing the flights to PAX and such, had emailed all of us, asking what kind of food we
                            wanted on the flight. She listed all the options, and one of them was “Bland”.<br>That
                            amused me immensely. It’s like having an option that says “over cooked” or “a bit on the
                            salty side, isn’t it?”. So naturally, after saying what me and Elin would prefer to eat, I
                            added that Carl wants bland food. He’s a bland food type of guy after all.<br>Lydia, who
                            didn’t pick up on the humor, went ahead and ordered that, and everybody forgot about it.</p>
                        <p>Lunch time on the flight to Seattle. It’s about an 11 hour flight or so. The stewardess told
                            Carl he was getting his “special” food, then got served a tiny portion of celery and some
                            salad.</p>
                        <p>Thing is, Carl doesn’t like bland food at all! Quite the contrary, he likes food with flavor,
                            and decent portions of it to boot.</p>
                        <p>We all had a big laugh about it. So much fun. Then he forgot to change his order back to
                            regular food in time for the flight back. ;D</p>
                        <p>So.. if you ever have dinner with Carl, remember that he likes BLAND food.</p>

                        <div class="post_title">Why no Steam, Notch?</div>
                        <p>At PAX, I got asked why we’re not on Steam with Minecraft, and I had to answer the question
                            straight out for the first time. So I’ll repeat what I said on here, because openess is
                            awesome.</p>
                        <p>Steam is the best digital distribution platform I’ve ever seen. I’ve spent incredible amounts
                            of money on it, and I own a crazy amount of games on it. It runs great, offers great
                            services like that shift+tab stuff, and it remembers my credit card details so there’s no
                            barrier for me when I want to buy a game. The only downside I can think of is that offline
                            mode is a bit flimsy, and that the game list is sometimes full off DLC releases for stuff I
                            don’t even own, and those are some tiny complaints!</p>
                        <p>But..</p>
                        <p>Being on Steam limits a lot of what we’re allowed to do with the game, and how we’re allowed
                            to talk to our users. We (probably?) wouldn’t be able to, say, sell capes or have a map
                            market place on minecraft.net that works with steam customers in a way that keeps Valve
                            happy. It would effectively split the Minecraft community into two parts, where only some of
                            the players can access all of the weird content we want to add to the game.</p>
                        <p>We are talking to Valve about this, but I definitely understand their reasons for wanting to
                            control their platform. There’s a certain inherent incompatibility between what we want to
                            do and what they want to do.</p>
                        <p>So there’s no big argument, we just don’t want to limit what we can do with Minecraft. Also,
                            Steam is awesome. Much more awesome than certain other digital distribution platforms that
                            we would NOT want to release Minecraft on.</p>

                            called a “knockout”, and now we’re putting together an awesome party tonight.</p>
                        <p>The only problem is that we haven’t invited anyone outside the company yet, and I don’t know
                            how many people the venue will hold. ;-D</p>
                        <p>I will be tweeting about it during the day, but if you’re an indie dev at pax who wants to go
                            to a 100% free party tonight, I’d say the odds are very good that you will be able to.</p>

                        <p>We’ve been in Seattle for three days now. The first day was just arriving and eating lunch
                            before crashing in bed. The next two days were meetings and planning with Microsoft, working
                            out some details for the XBox version of Minecraft and getting to know their team a bit
                            better. Today, we did a brief drop-by at Bungie to say hi (but not to Valve! Why not? I miss
                            those guys), then went to the PAX floor to help Elin, Lydia, Vu and a couple of volunteers
                            to help finish up the last details. While doing so, we found a couple of bugs in the 1.8
                            demo and I had to do some live bug fixing right there.</p>
                        <p>PAX starts tomorrow, and it’s going to be awesome. If you’re there, please come check out our
                            booth at the sixth floor, we’re very proud of it.</p>

                        <p>I am back, and I am excited.</p>
                        <p>Marriage has been wonderful so far, and nobody sabotaged my computer while I was gone.</p>
                        <p>The only negative thing going on at this moment is the Scrolls trademark lawsuit nonsense,
                            and I think I came up with the perfect solution:</p>
                        <p>Remember that scene in Game of Thrones where Tyrion chose a trial by battle in the Eyrie?
                            Well, let’s do that instead!<br> I challenge Bethesda to a game of Quake 3. Three of our
                            best warriors against three of your best warriors. We select one level, you select the
                            other, we randomize the order. 20 minute matches, highest total frag count per team across
                            both levels wins.</p>
                        <p>If we win, you drop the lawsuit.</p>
                        <p>If you win, we will change the name of Scrolls to something you’re fine with.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of the outcome, we could still have a small text somewhere saying our game is not
                            related to your game series in any way, if you wish.</p>
                        <p>I am serious, by the way.</p>

                        <div class="post_title">Bethesda are suing us, here's the full story!</div>
                        <p>A lot of people want more details about what is going on, so here is everything I know:</p>
                        <p>First of all, I love Bethesda. I assume this nonsense is partly just their lawyers being
                            lawyers, and a result of trademark law being the way it is.</p>
                        <p>About half a year ago, our lawyers recommended us to register “Minecraft” as a trademark, so
                            we did. I had voted against it initially, but we did it anyway. Better safe than sorry, and
                            all that. At the same time, we also applied for “Scrolls”, the new game we’re working on. We
                            knew of no similarly named games, and we had even googled it to make sure. I’m not even sure
                            if you CAN trademark individual words, like “Scrolls”, but we sent in the application
                            anyway.</p>
                        <p>(Disclosure: We’ve enforced the trademark for Minecraft once, when there was a minecraft
                            clone on iOS, using our name. People were emailing me saying our iOS version was buggy and
                            bad, so we asked them to change the name of their game, and they did.)</p>
                        <p>A while later, out of the blue, we got contacted by Bethesda’s lawyers. They wanted to know
                            more about the “Scrolls” trademark we were applying for, and claimed it conflicted with
                            their existing trademark “The Elder Scrolls”. I agree that the word “Scrolls” is part of
                            that trademark, but as a gamer, I have never ever considered that series of (very good) role
                            playing games to be about scrolls in any way, nor was that ever the focal point of neither
                            their marketing nor the public image.<br>The implication that you could own the right to all
                            individual words within a trademark is also a bit scary. We looked things up and realized
                            they didn’t have much of a case, but we still took it seriously. Nothing about Scrolls is
                            meant to in any way derive from or allude to their games. We suggested a compromise where
                            we’d agree to never put any words in front of “Scrolls”, and instead call sequels and other
                            things something along the lines of “Scrolls - The Banana Expansion”. I’m not sure if they
                            ever got back to us with a reply to this.</p>
                        <p>Today, I got a 15 page letter from some Swedish lawyer firm, saying they demand us to stop
                            using the name Scrolls, that they will sue us (and have already paid the fee to the Swedish
                            court), and that they demand a pile of money up front before the legal process has even
                            started.</p>
                        <p>I assume this is all some more or less automated response to us applying for the trademark. I
                            sincerely hope Bethesda isn’t pulling a Tim Langdell.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p><em>Well, it is a scam.</em></p>
                        <p>They made a voxel renderer, probably based on <a
                                href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSparse_voxel_octree&amp;t=MTZkMzlmNmQ4YWI3ZjhjMDEwZGY4NjE0ZTQ2ZmQzZTZhYjM2OGU2NSxkb0J6dVlCbg%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F8386977075%2Fits-a-scam">sparse
                                voxel octrees</a>. That’s cool and all, but.. To quote the video, the island in the
                            video is one km^2. Let’s assume a modest island height of just eight meters, and we end up
                            with 0.008 km^3. At 64 atoms per cubic millimeter (four per millimeter), that is a total of
                            512 000 000 000 000 000 atoms. If each voxel is made up of one byte of data, that is a total
                            of 512 petabytes of information, or about 170 000 three-terrabyte harddrives full of
                            information. In reality, you will need way more than just one byte of data per voxel to do
                            colors and lighting, and the island is probably way taller than just eight meters, so that
                            estimate is very optimistic.</p>
                        <p>So obviously, it’s not made up of that many unique voxels.</p>
                        <p>In the video, you can make up loads of repeated structured, all roughly the same size. Sparse
                            voxel octrees work great for this, as you don’t need to have unique data in each leaf node,
                            but can reference the same data repeatedly (at fixed intervals) with great speed and memory
                            efficiency. This explains how they can have that much data, but it also shows one of the
                            biggest weaknesses of their engine.</p>
                        <p>Another weakness is that voxels are horrible for doing animation, because there is no current
                            fast algorithms for deforming a voxel cloud based on a skeletal mesh, and if you do keyframe
                            animation, you end up with a LOT of data. It’s possible to rotate, scale and translate
                            individual chunks of voxel data to do simple animation (imagine one chunk for the upper arm,
                            one for the lower, one for the torso, and so on), but it’s not going to look as nice as
                            polygon based animated characters do.</p>
                        <p>It’s a very pretty and very impressive piece of technology, but they’re carefully avoiding to
                            mention any of the drawbacks, and they’re pretending like what they’re doing is something
                            new and impressive. In reality, it’s been done several times before.</p>
                        <p>There’s the very impressive looking Atomontage Engine: <a

                        <div class="post_title">Sharing an interesting email</div>
                        <p>I briefly talked to the crazy engineers over at Bat Country Entertainment about mods that
                            alter the height limit in Minecraft. Ryan send me this interesting email about what
                            different tradeoffs there are, and his experiences working with it:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Very cool! Off the top of my head, here’s a list of the main points:<br><br>Implications
                                behind changing height:<br><br>- Memory Implications: Due to the way chunks are
                                architected internally, the only relatively-easy way of increasing level height is to
                                double it. As a result, memory usage can spiral out of control very quickly when
                                increasing the number of bits available to the Y axis. A somewhat short-sighted view
                                would be to point out that this is wholly manageable in SSP, but pragmatically, SMP is
                                already a hornet’s nest when it comes to RAM usage, and the only way to increase the
                                level height would be to neatly double the memory footprint. Ouch!<br><br>- CPU
                                Implications: Chunk terrain generation occurs in pieces on the X/Z plane, but expects
                                the chunk to be fully populated along the Y axis, from bedrock to sky. To be fair, much
                                of this can be mitigated by the fact that any terrain above a certain cutoff can be
                                assumed to be completely air, and any terrain below a certain cutoff can be assumed to
                                be completely stone, thus eliminating the need for temperature / humidity / biome
                                calculations far down in the level or high up in the level. Nonetheless, it’s still a
                                cache-thrashing memory-fill operation. Worse still, due to the fact that subterranean
                                features are populated per-chunk, to maintain a consistent distribution of ore you would
                                need to double the number of calls made to any given feature generator as well for each
                                doubling of the Y axis. While this is relatively cheap for things like ore, it’s
                                eclipsed by the idea that cave generation would need to occur along the entire Y axis,
                                and being a recursive function, this has the potential to get very costly very
                                quickly.<br><br>- Storage Implications: Anything stored in memory needs to be serialized
                                to disk and read back from disk. Given the fact that in SSP, the number-one performance
                                killer - even on my beastly computer - is disk I/O, it would be a highly questionable
                                idea to double the amount of data that needs to be written out to disk. I’m not
                                completely sure if chunks are gzipped before being written to disk, or if that only
                                occurs to chunks when transmitted over the network, but if they are, this simply robs
                                from Peter to pay Paul - it mitigates the disk I/O issue while increasing the enormity
                                of the CPU issue.<br><br>- Network Implications: On SMP, Chunks need to be sent to many
                                more people many times more often than in SSP. It can be taken for granted, from a
                                client’s perspective, just how much data needs to be shoved around by the server, and
                                although network packets are gzipped, it’s still an additional networking load, and
                                still an additional CPU load as well.<br><br>Regarding changing the level height, it was
                                “easy” to the extent that it took me around 4 hours yesterday morning to do it, but only
                                because I’ve been poking around the engine internals since January and have been
                                mentally keeping track of all of the assumptions in the code on exactly that topic. From
                                top to bottom:<br><br>- Search through the codebase for &lt;&lt; 11 and &lt;&lt; 7,
                                replace with &lt;&lt; 12 and &lt;&lt; 8 as necessary.<br>- Search through the codebase
                                for 128, this will hit the majority of places that assume the map height as being 128,
                                such as tile height checks.<br> - When changing the above locations, save yourself a
                                recompile and make sure to change any variables from bytes to shorts or ints if you’re
                                increasing them past 128. Being a C++ engineer, I keep forgetting that everything is
                                implied as signed in Java.<br> - Search through the codebase for 127, this will hit the
                                remainder of places that assume the map height as being 128.<br>- Search through the
                                codebase for 64 and 63, this will hit the places that assume sea level is at 64, as well
                                as Iron’s ore generator height cutoff. Personally, I dialed sea level up to 96 from 64,
                                rather than fully double it up to 128, in order to have 32 additional tiles’ worth of
                                water height, but have an entire 96 additional tiles’ worth of land height.<br> - Fix up
                                the level feature generators for Redstone, diamond, gold et al.<br>- Visually grep
                                through all of the level feature generator classes, doubling the RNG baseline and spread
                                for each one.<br>- Change a few instances of 32768 to 65536 to accommodate 16*256*16
                                rather than 16*128*16.<br> - I’m not sure how much of this is a result of JAD and how
                                much of it is actual code, but there are a few instances of “char whatever = ’\200’;” in
                                the MCP codebase, change it to a short or int containing 256 instead of 128.<br><br>I
                                have to say that the game was *remarkably* performant with the Y height pushed up to
                                256. I imagine 512 might not be too bad on my beast of a machine, either, though 1024
                                would be pushing it. That said, one of my short-term “just for fun” goals is to see if I
                                can’t get the Nether to populate from 0-127, the main world from 128-255, your Sky
                                dimension from 256-383, and then that one group of modders’ new dimension, the Aether,
                                from 384-511. That would be epic.<br><br>Additionally, there’s a mod that some guy made
                                that re-works chunks to be 16x16x16 (it appears), but I’m rather nonplused by it. The
                                bug list is as long as my arm, and it doesn’t actually rescale any of the
                                terrain-generation features, so you don’t get neat things like this: <a target="_blank"

                                a result, I’m in the process of just trying to re-do what he did on my own. I’m filling
                                all chunks above Y=256 entirely with air, filling all chunks below 0 with stone,
                                manually invoking the cave generator, and theoretically things should just work. In
                                principle, theory is a flimsy thing to go on, and to that end I’ve been chasing down
                                bugs for the past 4-5 hours. At present I’m able to get in-game, but the chunks are
                                horribly mis-arranged, so I suspect I’ve missed an important hashing function somewhere,
                                since that would also explain why it’s spitting out reams of “Wrong location!”
                                exceptions that it’s spitting out whenever it tries to spawn animals - the level
                                provider is providing the wrong chunk.</p>

                        <p>Most of the basics of the game engine is in place, so it’s time to flesh this game out into
                            something more gamey. More content, more exploration, more things to do, and interesting
                            combat! Once this update is out, there will only some tweaks, optimizations and code
                            cleanups left to the core game before we can call it a full release.</p>
                        <p>We’ve got a list of some 40+ things we want to add to the game, some small, some big. Some
                            huge. We’ve finished a fair number of the items, but there’s still a significant amount of
                            work left. While I can’t reveal the date yet for various reasons, we do have a release date
                            for the Adventure Update in mind, and we’re hoping we’ll be able to hit it.</p>
                        <p>Jens and I are keeping the exact contents of the update secret, but we do leak some
                            information every now and then to keep people interested and to stop us from going insane.

                        <p>I’ve received a few emails about Bill S.978, a new bill proposed in the USA, which would make
                            it illegal under certain circumstances to share videos of copyrighted materials over the
                            internet. The problem is that it appears to also make it illegal to upload videos of games,
                            such as let’s plays and speed runs. And I love watching let’s plays and speed runs.</p>
                        <p>Here’s a great video on the subject I found via Reddit: <a
                                href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dib7-vSrp6y8&amp;t=OWZhMDU1MzBlODg3NWZiMmZlN2UzZTEwMzYzYTgxZWZhNDQwOWU4NyxZSTZlY2ZITw%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F7152523035%2Fbill-s978">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib7-vSrp6y8</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>If the bill passes, I suspect many game companies (including us) will add a special clause to
                            the TOS specifically to allow posting videos of their games. A huge part of why Minecraft
                            has grown so fast is the YouTube community.</p>

                        <p>Since 1.8 is still a significant time away, we’re going to have to stop being as secretive
                            about it as we have. We’ll provide information about it as we go, but we’ll keep actual
                            details secret. So, for example, we could say “added two new colors” without saying which
                            ones, or “testing experience and leveling to see if it’s fun” without giving details on
                            exactly how it works.</p>
                        <p>The update is pretty big, and will change a lot of how Minecraft is played, focusing on
                            making exploration and combat much more rewarding, and bringing in a bigger sense of
                            adventure to the game.</p>
                        <p>Already implemented are new complex terrain features, at least one new mob, some interesting
                            new combat mechanics, a new lighting engine, and some experimental new gameplay ideas. To
                            come is more interesting farming, bigger incentives to explore, and npc villages.</p>

                        <p>After a few weeks out of the office (E3, then Italy, then F.3.A.R this weekend (great
                            game!)), I’m finally back in the office. The chair is a lot more comfortable than I
                            remember, and the office is overflowing with irony. While I was gone, we’ve hired another
                            graphics artist to help out with Scrolls, Mattis (<a
                                href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2F%23%21%2Fbomuboi&amp;t=NGFkY2RlZDg1ZDg1ZGJjMjA0OGNkNzViNTllYTNmMjliMTkzNzIyZixUV25YRnV5VA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3ApldZIR1BSGsjkquhfDfJDg&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnotch.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F6969771554%2Fback-in-the-office-and-some-words-on-17-and-18">@bomuboi</a>
                            on twitter), and two more potential employees are being talked to. More news on that when
                            we’ve signed them.</p>
                        <p>Me and Jens have been independently working on stuff for the adventure update, and it’s been
                            growing in scope as we’ve been working on it. That means it will take quite some time to
                            finish, but that it will hopefully change the game a lot to the better. To prevent going too
                            far between updates, we’ve decided to release Pistons early.</p>
                        <p>That means 1.7 will be released soon, containing only pistons and probably a couple of bug
                            fixes. The adventure update will take however long it takes, and will be released as 1.8. It
                            might be a long wait, but it will be worth it!</p>
                        <p>After 1.8, we’ll have to start crunching for the full release in November. That includes
                            finishing up the mod api, improving stability and performance, adding supporting features
                            like friends lists and a proper server browser, integrating singleplayer and multiplayer,
                            and most importantly fleshing out the gameplay.</p>
                        <p>The release date is almost certainly changed to sometime the week after 11/11/11, and we’re
                            working hard on setting that up. We want to make a big spectacle out of the release where we
                            involve fans and celebrate it properly.</p>
                        <p>Then we’ll rest for a few weeks. Then I’ll start working on the first post-release update. :D

                        <p>Hi! E3 is over, and we’re flying back to Sweden in a few hours. I have loads of information
                            and news to share, so here’s a rambling information dump:</p>
                        <p>* Minecraft fans are amazing. I spent a fair bit of time at E3 signing t-shirts and cardboard
                            heads, trying to speak with as many fans as possible, and every single person was super
                            friendly and nice.</p>
                        <p>* It looks like we need to change the release date for Minecraft to be able to get a good
                            venue for MinecraftCon. 11/11/11 is fully booked. One week later, perhaps? I’ll post more
                            details as soon as we’ve decided and booked a venue.</p>
                        <p>* Minecraft is coming to XBox 360. It will be a new version of the game, designed
                            specifically for console play. We haven’t decided on a name yet. It will feature (but not
                            require) Kinect support, and is being released “this winter”. It will be a 360 exclusive
                            title.</p>
                        <p>* Minecraft is coming to Xperia PLAY. It will be a new version of the game, designed
                            specifically for mobile play. This version is called “Minecraft - Pocket Edition”. It’s
                            built as a native Android game, and will take full use of the Xperia PLAY controls. After
                            some period of exclusivity, we will release it for all modern Android phones.</p>
                        <p>* On both these platforms, I’m going to be more secretive about giving out details. This is
                            because there are actual PR budgets on them, and I don’t want to mess up any big plans.</p>
                        <p>* I will be the game designer on both new Minecraft titles, but I won’t be involved in the
                            programming as I’m focused on the PC version of Minecraft.</p>
                        <p>* We are working on Minecraft Beta 1.7, which I’m referring to as the “adventure update”.
                            We’re keeping the details secret so people can get surprises. The idea with this update is
                            to flesh out the game a bit, making it reward exploration and combat more. Assuming we like
                            them in play testing, pistons are coming in 1.7.</p>
                        <p>* I’ve now been to the Playboy Mansion! Woo! Not related to Minecraft at all, but I just
                            wanted to share that. :D</p>
                        <p>* Speaking of not Minecraft related, I got to see the Skyrim demo (thanks, Tim), and it’s
                            freaking amazing. While the dragons in the demo were obviously scripted (he knew exactly
                            where they would land and such), they claim they’re fully dynamic and unscripted in the full
                            game.</p>
                        <p>* We’re starting the modding support on a small scale with 1.7. We’ll be giving the source
                            code out to a very VERY small group of people before the release of 1.7. We’ll use those
                            experiences to work out the final details, then we’ll get the modding api out as soon as
                            possible after 1.7 has been released.</p>
                        <p>* Again, if you weren’t ware, the “modding api” is the entire source code for Minecraft,
                            uncensored and unobfuscated. You need to agree to certain terms to get access, though, but
                            anyone can apply.</p>
