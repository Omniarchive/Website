<h1 class="size3">Omniarchive?</h1>
<div class="size6">
    <p>
        Omniarchive is a community that focuses on the preservation of all official Minecraft content.
        Although we archive all editions of Minecraft, our main focus is finding and archiving versions of Java Edition that are lost to time and are no longer
        available.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since its inception in September 2017 by HalfOfAKebab, the Omniarchive community has recovered more than 80 previously missing versions, mostly from the
        game's early development stages during 2009-2011.
        We are actively looking for more versions, with our usual methods being to contact players that played during these early days.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our community also actively focuses on documentation of the early history of Minecraft and its community, so it can be preserved for all to see.
        This work includes finding proof of existence of versions previously unknown to exist, archiving screenshots and videos, and contributing to the
        Minecraft Wiki.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although we don't have any official archives of fanmade content, many members of the community also actively archive mods, tools, and worlds; especially
        those from Minecraft's early days.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of archival, we also have a large Discord community focused on a shared love of old versions of Minecraft, as well as the game in general
        including newer versions.
        We also host gaming events for the community, and we aim to make these more of a regular occurence in future.

        - Omni and LMM basically got everything that was online in 2017-early 2018, a lot of
        which had been for years at that point (2010-2013 sort of time I think) including
        0.0.13a_03, 0.0.23a_01, 0.30, 0.30 ST, in-20100223, in-20100130, in-20100203,
        inf-20100227, inf-20100415, inf-20100420, inf-20100608, inf-20100627 etc. Basically if
        it isn't mentioned elsewhere it was probably found before Omni.<br>
        - 17th September 2017, Zuriki, this was originally in LMM though but also given to omni
        later on, basically everything from the og retrocraft site except for the infdevs. Which
        I think is 0.27, 0.28_01, 0.29_02, 0.0.21a, in-20100111-1, in-20100125-1 and -2,
        basically anything after and including in-20100207-1, except for in-20100207-2 and
        anything already found (in-20100223)<br>
        - 14th October 2017 Lucario found a texture modded a1.0.1_01 on an old forum thread.<br>
        - 4th April 2018, DBN: in-20100201-1, 0.0.22a_05, inf-20100327. (First one I was here
        personally for)<br>
        - 20th April 2018, bildramer: in-20100129.
        Also in his zip was what we now know as RC2-1 (previously RCX) but somehow we managed to
        miss this for literally over a year lmao.<br>
        - 25th April 2018, GCB found texture modded inf-20100330 on the MCForums from an old
        thread.<br>
        - 12th May 2018, calzoneman: in-20100131 and in-20100201-2.<br>
        - 22nd May 2018, UnknownX: All of the remaining versions from the original retrocraft
        website, which was inf-20100607, inf-20100624, inf-20100625-1 and -2, inf-20100629 and
        one of the in-20100207 ones, I can't remember if it was -2 or -1 but we had one of them
        before him. Some of these were texture modded (a couple of the infdevs) and he also gave
        us a1.0.1_01 non texture modded.<br>
        - 10th June 2018, RidgeX:
        A shit ton of versions, you know the story, there's lists out there somewhere but it was
        like almost every other infdev and lots more. Includes all the non modified versions of
        the ones sent by UnknownX.<br>
        - 18th March 2019, Searge: a1.2.3_05. Him and Dinnerbone also sent a lot of previously
        missing beta and I think release prerelease servers.<br>
        - 22nd March 2019, joeyjo0: 0.29_01 texture modded (literally just the rain texture
        though)<br>
        - 20th October 2019, Rotab: 0.0.14a_08 and 0.0.16a_02(-2)<br>
