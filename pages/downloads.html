        <p>The very first builds of Minecraft still available today, all created within hours/days of its
            inception on May 13th 2009.
            All of these are taken from the launcher, where they were first made available in 2013 by
            Dinnerbone.
            Although not fully confirmed, it has been indicated that these came from a source code backup on
            an old computer/backup that belonged to Notch, as well as from his ex-wife ez.
            These builds are not signed or obfuscated but have been altered to work in the launcher hence why
            they have a 2013 modified date.</p>

        <p>All currently found versions from the first public release of Minecraft onwards up until 0.30
            released in November 2009.
            Over the course of Classic various blocks are added, as well as the implementation of
            multiplayer and many UI changes including the hotbar and inventory.
            Survival Test also occurred during classic which added the basic survival features of the health
            bar and consuming food, as well as mobs and finite blocks.
            Includes some dev versions from the launcher and versions found both online and from old players
            by Omniarchive over the past few years.</p>

        <p>All currently found versions from the first Indev on December 23rd 2009 until the last on
            February 23rd 2010.
            Standing for in-development, Indev was the first fully paid era of the game and was intended to
            act as a way for players to experience all of the latest features added by Notch firsthand.
            Indev introduced many features that are essential for what Minecraft is known for today,
            including non-block items, mining, crafting, smelting and farming, as well as finite water and
            many other features.
            Includes various versions found online and from old players by Omniarchive over the past few
            years.</p>

        <p>All currently found versions from the first Infdev on February 27th 2010 until the last on June
            30th 2010 (debatable...).
            Infdev stands for infinite-development, due to its addition of infinite worlds.
            Much of Infdev was spent optimising the feature of infinite worlds and adding back features from
            Indev that were broken due to it.
            Towards the end of Infdev some smaller features were added such as doors, signs, stairs,
            dungeons, minecarts etc.
            Includes various versions found online and from old players by Omniarchive over the past few
            years.

        <hr>
        <p>All currently found versions from Alpha 1.0 (technically...) to Alpha 1.2.6.
            Alpha introduced many features to the game including chickens, cows, redstone, boats, slimes and
            later Survival Multiplayer, biomes and the Nether.
            Alpha is also when Minecraft's popularity began to surge and other developers than Notch began
            working on the game at the end of it due to this.
            Includes various versions found online and from old players by Omniarchive over the past few
            years.

        <p>Minecraft4k is a stripped down version of the game written by Notch for the 7th Java4k
            competition in
            December 2009.
            After taking part in the contest since 2005 and even winning it in previous years, Notch decided
            to
            rewrite Minecraft from scratch for the competition this year. 2 versions exist with some
            differences, both are archived and available here.</p>

        <p>This is a JavaScript remake of Classic 0.0.23a_01 released by Mojang to classic.minecraft.net in
            May 2019 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Minecraft. It originally had multiplayer
            compatibility but this has been broken on the official website as of late 2019. The remake is
            not entirely accurate to the original version due to some bugs and gameplay oddities. There have
            been 4 different versions of the remake, all are archived and can be played down below. <b>Keep in mind that
                multiplayer does not work.</b>
