description: Welcome to Omniarchive - The largest archive of Minecraft versions!

<div class="header"><em>"Help us preserve the past!"</em></div><br>
<p>
    Omniarchive is a community that focuses on preserving all official Minecraft content. Although we archive all 
    editions of Minecraft, our main focus is finding and archiving versions of Java Edition that are lost to time
    and are no longer available.<br><br>

    Since its inception in September 2017 by HalfOfAKebab, the Omniarchive community has recovered more than 80
    previously missing versions, mostly from the game's early development stages during 2009-2011. We are actively
    looking for more versions, with our usual methods being to contact players that played during these early days.<br><br>

    Our community also actively focuses on documenting the early history of Minecraft and its community, so it can
    be preserved for all to see. This work includes finding proof of the existence of versions previously unknown 
    to exist, archiving screenshots and videos, and contributing to the Minecraft Wiki.<br><br>

    Although we don't have any official archives of fanmade content, many members of the community also actively 
    archive mods, tools, and worlds; especially those from Minecraft's early days.<br><br>

    Outside of archival, we also have a large Discord community focused on a shared love of old versions of Minecraft,
    as well as the game in general including newer versions. We also host gaming events for the community, and we 
    aim to make these more of a regular occurrence in the future.
