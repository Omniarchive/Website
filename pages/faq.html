<div class="header">WHERE CAN I DOWNLOAD THE VERSIONS?</div><br>
<p>Links to the archive can be found in the <a href="/downloads">Downloads section</a>.</p><br>

<div class="header">DO YOU HAVE [INSERT VERSION HERE]?</div><br>
<p>Check <a href="/sheet">the index</a> for a comprehensive list on which versions we do and do not have.</p><br>

<div class="header">DOESN'T THE LAUNCHER HAVE EVERY VERSION?</div><br>
<p>While the launcher has many versions available to play, it is far from having every version. There are dozens of
    versions we have archived that are not in the launcher. In fact, some of the versions in the launcher were modified,
    whereas we have the original copies as they were on release.</p><br>

<div class="header">I THINK I'VE FOUND A MISSING VERSION; WHAT SHOULD I DO?</div><br>
<p>Join our <a href="/discord">Discord Server</a> and send a DM to one of the moderators and they will check it for
    you. If you're tech-savvy and want to be reasonably sure you've got something new before sending it to us, generate
    a file hash for the jar and see if that hash has already been marked as found on the <a href="/sheet">version
        index</a>.<br>Please do not upload jar files directly in the server, as explained in our server rules.
</p><br>

<div class="header">HOW DO I FIX CRASHES, SKINS, AND SOUNDS?</div><br>
<p>As these versions get older, more things break as Mojang updates their own infrastructure and as newer hardware and
    operating system updates are released. Not all of these issues can be completely solved, however there are tools
    generously made by members of our community that iron out some of these problems.<br><br>

    Some solutions are listed below. Please note that you should only use one of these tools; using a combination is
    unsupported and may result in unpredictable or undesired behaviour.<br><br>

    To use a proxy, paste them into the JVM arguments field in your launcher profile.<br><br>

    <b>BetaCraft</b><br>
    BetaCraft has a proxy and a launcher. The proxy only fixes skins, sounds, and crashes, whereas the launcher has more
    features. These features include multiplayer authentication, resolution fixes in Classic, Discord RPC support,
    Classic saving, and more. Download it <a
        href="https://github.com/Moresteck/BetaCraft-Launcher-Java/releases">here</a>.<br><br>

    BetaCraft proxy: -Dhttp.proxyHost=betacraft.uk<br><br>

    It is also recommended to use the following JVM argument with the BetaCraft proxy:<br>
    -Djava.util.Arrays.useLegacyMergeSort=true<br><br>

    There is no need to use either of the JVM arguments if you use the BetaCraft launcher.<br><br>

    <b>RetroWrapper</b><br>
    RetroWrapper fixes some bugs, fixes skins and sounds, adds online saving, and has a teleportation hack and isometric
    viewer. Find the download and installation instructions <a
        href="https://github.com/NeRdTheNed/RetroWrapper">here</a>
</p><br>

<div class="header">WHY DO OLD VERSIONS COMPLETELY FREEZE MY COMPUTER?</div><br>
<p>This is a bug with Windows 10 version 1809. This is the only version this bug affects, so to fix it, either update to
    1903 (or later), or downgrade to 1803 (or earlier). To check what version of Windows 10 you're using, press Win+R,
    type winver, and hit enter. The window that opens will tell you the version of Windows 10 you're running. There is
    no known way to fix this bug other than to install a version of Windows 10 that isn't affected.
</p><br>

<div class="header">HOW DO I KNOW WHICH SERVERS AND CLIENTS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH EACH OTHER?</div><br>
<p>Whether or not a client can connect to a server depends on the protocol version number (PVN) of both the client and
    the server. If the PVN matches, they are compatible. For example, clients a1.0.16 to a1.0.16_02 (inclusive) all have
    a PVN of 14. Server versions a0.1.2_01 and a0.1.3 also have a PVN of 14, meaning that all those clients are
    compatible with both those servers.<br><br>
    To find the PVN of a client or server, take a look at <a href="/sheet">the index</a>.</p><br>

<div class="header">WHY DO CLOUDS LOOK WEIRD?</div><br>
<p>Beta 1.7.3 and older have graphical bugs when using most AMD graphics cards, which is most noticeable when looking at
    clouds with Fancy graphics.<br><br>

    The BetaCraft launcher has a fix automatically applied without needing to modify your client jar file. You can
    download the BetaCraft launcher <a
        href="https://github.com/Moresteck/BetaCraft-Launcher-Java/releases">here</a>.<br><br>

    Alternatively, HalfOfAKebab has made a jar mod for a lot of versions that copies code from Beta 1.8 (which does not
    have these graphical issues). You can download it <a
        href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/369990015096455168/380887559288389633/BitDepthFix.zip">here</a>.
</p><br>

<div class="header">CAN I BE NOTIFIED WHEN A LOST VERSION HAS BEEN FOUND?</div><br>
<p>Every time a new version is found, it's announced in #changelogs along with a ping to the Notification Squad role. To
    join the Notification Squad, join the <a href="/discord">Discord Server</a> and type !role Notification Squad.
</p><br>

<div class="header">HAVE YOU HEARD OF LUIGI2600'S HIDDEN VERSIONS?</div><br>
<p>Yes, and a lot of them are either heavily modified or outright fake. If you have downloaded his archive, it is highly
    recommended that you delete it and instead download our archive.</p><br>

<div class="header">HOW DO I PLAY THESE OLD VERSIONS?</div><br>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZ3C2VLjCzFlNPjy3DDEow">Bugmancx</a> has made a great video detailing all
    the different ways you can enjoy these old versions - you can check it
